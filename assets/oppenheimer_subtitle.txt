- [thudding stops]
- [sighs]

5
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:19,914
[chairman] Dr. Oppenheimer.

6
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,833
Dr. Oppenheimer.

7
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,838
As we begin, I believe you have
a statement to read into the record.

8
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,925
Yes, Your Honor.

9
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,219
[board member] We're not judges, Doctor.

10
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,971
No.

11
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,264
[quietly] Of course.

12
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,854
Members of the security board.

13
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:48,484
The so-called and derogatory information
in your indictment of me

14
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,152
cannot be fairly understood,

15
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:53,698
except in the context of my life
and my work.

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,242
[Senate aide] How long did he testify?

17
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,786
Honestly, I forget.

18
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,164
The whole hearing took a month.

19
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,457
An ordeal.

20
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,544
I've only read the transcripts, but...
[clears throat]

21
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,089
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

22
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,800
- You weren't there?
- As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

23
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,011
Are they really going to ask about it?

24
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,221
It was years ago.

25
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:18,889
- Four years ago. [chuckles]
- Five.

26
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,559
Oppenheimer still divides America.

27
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,936
The committee is gonna want to know
where you stood.

28
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,316
Senator Thurmond asked me to say
not to feel that you're on trial.

29
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,402
Aw. Funny,
I didn't till you just said that.

30
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,570
Really, Mr. Strauss—

31
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,738
It's Admiral.

32
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,532
Admiral Strauss. This is a formality.

33
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,826
President Eisenhower has asked you
to be in his cabinet.

34
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,661
Senate really has no choice
but to confirm you.

35
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:43,080
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

36
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,499
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

37
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,793
No senator can deny you did your duty.

38
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,670
It'll be uncomfortable. [chuckles]

39
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,214
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

40
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,300
[loud chattering]

41
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,178
[shutter clicks]

42
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,056
[prosecutor]
Why did you leave the United States?

43
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,353
I, uh, wanted to study the new physics.

44
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,896
[chairman] Was there nowhere here?

45
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,733
I thought Berkeley had the leading
theoretical physics department.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,402
Yes. Once I had built it.

47
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,029
But first I had to go to Europe.

48
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:18,449
I went to Cambridge
to study under Patrick Blackett.

49
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,910
Were you happier there than in America?

50
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,120
- Happier?
- Yes.

51
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,751
No.

52
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,002
No, I, uh...

53
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,757
<i>I was homesick, um,</i>

54
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,718
emotionally immature,

55
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:44,100
troubled by visions of a hidden universe.

[energy pulsing]

00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,862

Christ, Oppenheimer.

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,163
Have you had any sleep?

61
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,291
Start again.

62
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,585
I need to go to the lecture, sir.

63
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,212
Why?

64
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,089
It's Niels Bohr.

65
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,218
I'd completely forgot.

66
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,263
All right. [clears throat] Let's go.

67
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:27,351
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
You finish coating those plates.

68
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,978
[students chattering, laughing]

[cupboard door closes]

70
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,812
[Bohr]
<i>Quantum physics is not a step forward.</i>

71
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,691
It is a new way to understand reality.

72
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,568
Einstein's opened the door.

73
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,906
Now we are peering through,
seeing a world inside our world.

74
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:27,244
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

[students chattering]

78
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,122
- Yeah— Are you all right?
- [breathing heavily]

79
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,334
Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

80
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,503
What's the J stand for?

81
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,921
Nothing, apparently.

82
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,507
You were at my lecture.
You asked the only good question.

83
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,175
[Blackett] No one's denying his insight.

84
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,553
It's his laboratory work
that leaves a little to be desired.

85
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,888
I heard you give the same lectu—

86
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,474
At Harvard, yes,
and you asked the same question.

87
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,642
Why ask again?

88
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,977
Hadn't liked your answer.

89
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,230
Did you like it better yesterday?

90
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,356
A lot.

91
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,944
You can lift the stone without being ready
for the snake that's revealed.

92
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,154
Now it seems you're ready.

93
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,698
But you don't enjoy the lab?

94
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,493
So get out of Cambridge
with its beakers and potions.

95
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,204
Go somewhere they'll let you think.

96
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,290
[whispers] Where?

97
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,750
Göttingen.

98
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,711
- Born.
- Born.

99
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,504
Get to Germany. Study under Max Born.

100
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,132
Learn the ways of theory.

101
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,258
I'll send word.

102
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,136
- Wormhole.
- [apple clatters]

103
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,930
How's your mathematics?

104
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,016
Not good enough
for the physicist he wants to be.

105
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,351
Algebra's like sheet music.

106
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,604
The important thing isn't
"can you read music?"

107
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,188
It's "can you hear it?"

108
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,608
Can you hear the music, Robert?

109
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,860
Yes, I can.

110
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,054

00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,791
The senator from Wyoming.

114
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:02,918
Admiral Strauss,

115
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,422
I'm interested in your relationship
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

116
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,215
You met him in 1947?

117
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,758
Correct.

118
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,053
You were commissioner
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

119
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:18,267
I was, but I actually met Robert
in my capacity as board member

120
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,728
of the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton,

121
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,772
because after the war
he was world renowned

122
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,065
as the great man of physics,

123
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,319
and I was determined
to get him to run the Institute.

124
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,790
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

125
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:42,958
Mr. Strauss.

126
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,252
It's pronounced "straws."

127
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,795
Oh-ppenheimer, Oppenheimer.

128
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,630
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

129
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,882
[chuckles]

130
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,885
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El
in Manhattan.

131
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,554
"Straws" is just
the Southern pronunciation.

132
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,723
Anyway, welcome to the Institute.

133
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,391
I think you could be very happy here.

134
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,518
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

135
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,146
The position comes with that house
for you and your wife,

136
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,106
and your— Is it two children?

137
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,191
Yes, two.

138
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,152
I'm a great admirer of your work.

139
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,529
And you're a physicist by training,
Mr. Strauss?

140
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,698
I'm sorry, common room, four o'clock tea.

141
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,493
No, I'm not trained in physics
or anything else.

142
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,619
I'm a self-made man.

143
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,205
- Ah. I can relate to that.
- Really?

144
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,081
Yes, my father was one.

145
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,960
And this would be your office.

146
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,926
[birds chirping]

147
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,347
I'm told he's there most afternoons.

148
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,557
You know, I've always wondered

149
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,602
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

150
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,106
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

151
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,316
Of his time.

152
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,277
Einstein published
his Theory of Relativity

153
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,988
more than 40 years ago now.

154
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,659
But never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.

155
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,160
"God doesn't play dice."

156
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,287
Precisely.

157
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,082
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

158
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,793
I had offers, but I chose to sell shoes.

159
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,712
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

160
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,841
No, just a shoe salesman.

161
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,175
[chuckles]

162
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,221
I'd love to introduce you.

163
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,430
No need.

164
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,724
I have known him for years.

165
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,497
Albert.

166
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,128
What was that?

167
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,172
What did you say to him?

168
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,676
Oh, he's fine.

169
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:04,308
Mr. Strauss, there are things in my past
you ought to be aware of.

170
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,686
Well, as chairman of the AEC,
I have access to your security file.

171
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,770
I've read it.

172
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,397
- You're not worried?
- No.

173
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,733
Why would I be worried after everything
you've done for your country?

174
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,776
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

175
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,820
Well, the purpose of this institute

176
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,197
is to provide
a haven for independent minds.

177
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,408
That's you.

178
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,285
You are the man for the job.

179
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,871
Well, then I'll consider it.

180
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,040
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

181
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,753
[scoffs]

182
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,422
This is one of the most prestigious
appointments in the country.

183
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,633
Yes, with a great commute.

184
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,760
That's why I'm considering it.

185
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,973
[McGee] <i>So, Dr. Oppenheimer brought
your attention to his past associations</i>

186
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,475
before you appointed him?

187
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,269
- Yes.
- And they didn't concern you?

188
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,940
Just then I was entirely consumed
with what he must have said to Einstein

189
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,692
- to sour him on me.
- [gallery laughing]

190
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,196
But later?

191
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
Well, we all know what happened later.

192
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,784
[prosecutor]
Doctor, your time in Europe,

193
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,912
you seemed to meet with a wide range
of other countries' physicists.

194
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,996
Yes, that's right.

195
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,373
Any Russians?

196
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,376
None that spring to mind.

197
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,962
If you'll just allow me
to continue with my statement—

198
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,465
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample opportunity
to cross-examine.

199
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,388
After Göttingen,
I moved on to Leiden in Holland,

200
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,390
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

201
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,558
[Rabi clears throat] Excuse me.

202
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,691
A Yank, lecturing on the new physics?

203
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,775
This I have to hear.

204
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,944
I'm an American myself.

205
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,153
How surprising.

206
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,740
Let me know if you need any help
with the English.

207
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,869
[students laughing]

208
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,208
[speaking Dutch]

209
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,172
Wait, what's he saying?

210
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,560
No, thank you.

211
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,478
It's a long way to Zurich.

212
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,106
You get any skinnier, we're gonna
lose you between the seat cushions.

213
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,983
I'm Rabi.

214
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,359
Oppenheimer.

215
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,403
I caught your lecture on molecules.

216
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,696
Caught some of it.

217
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,907
We're a couple of New York Jews.
How do you know Dutch?

218
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,869
Well, I thought I'd better learn it
when I got here this semester.

219
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,164
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

220
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,707
Wanted to challenge myself.

221
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,084
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

222
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,753
- <i>Schvitzer.</i>
- <i>Schvitzer</i>?

223
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,337
- Show-off.
- [chuckles]

224
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,631
Dutch in six weeks,
but you never learned Yiddish?

225
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,675
They don't speak it so much
my side of the park.

226
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,177
Screw you.

227
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,764
- You homesick?
- Oh, you know it.

228
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,768
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

229
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,852
Physicists?

230
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,395
That's funny.

231
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,022
Not in the department.

232
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,774
They're all Jewish too.

233
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,985
Eat.

234
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,823
There's a German you have to seek out.

235
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,451
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

236
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,247
[Heisenberg speaking German]

237
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,590
One might be led to the presumption
that behind the quantum world,

238
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,469
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

239
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,890
but such speculations seem to us,
to say it explicitly, fruitless.

240
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,850
Thank you. Have a great day.

241
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,398
- Werner. Wonderful.
- Thank you.

242
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,234
Dr. Oppenheimer.

243
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,029
Oppenheimer, yes.
I liked your paper on molecules.

244
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,531
Probably because you inspired it.

245
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,242
If I inspire anything else, let me know.
We could publish together.

246
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,952
I have to get back to America.

247
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,078
Why?

248
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,956
There's no one there
taking quantum mechanics seriously.

249
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,624
That's exactly why.

250
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,127
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

251
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,504
Canyons of New Mexico.

252
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,630
You're from New Mexico?

253
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,217
No. New York, but my brother and I
have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

254
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,803
That's the America I miss right now.

255
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:13,140
- Then it's best you get home, cowboys.
- [Oppenheimer, Rabi chuckle]

256
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,224
That's him.

257
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,185
No, me and horses? I don't think so.

258
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,604
Nice to meet you.

259
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,733
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

260
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,861
Not in person, no, but, uh...

261
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,990
you might say our paths crossed.

262
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,951
On returning to America,

263
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,954
I accepted positions at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

264
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,079
[people chattering]

265
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,956
[people chattering]

266
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,339
[equipment clattering]

267
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
[sighs]

268
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,230
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

269
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,401
- You must be Oppenheimer.
- Yes.

270
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,154
I hear you want to start
a school of quantum theory.

271
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,989
I am starting it. Next door.

272
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,240
They put you in there?

273
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,577
I asked for it. Wanted to be close
to you experimentalists.

274
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,329
Theory will get you only so far, huh?

275
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,331
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

276
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,415
Magnificent.

277
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:21,917
Would you like to help?

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,835
Build it? Oh, no. [chuckles]

279
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,920
No, no.

280
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,672
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

281
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,049
When do you start teaching?

282
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,425
I've got my first in an hour.

283
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,469
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

284
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,347
One student? That's it?

285
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,558
I'm teaching something
no one here has dreamt of.

286
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,560
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it—

287
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,103
There's no going back.

288
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,563
[door opens]

289
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,108
- Oh. I must have missed the-
- Mr. Lomanitz?

290
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,193
Nah—

291
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,654
Yeah.

292
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,738
Yes, this is it.

293
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,657
Please. Take a seat.

294
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,909
[clears throat]

295
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,580
What do you know
about quantum mechanics?

296
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,583
I have a grasp on the basics.

297
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,043
Then you're doing it wrong.

298
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,171
Is light made up of particles or waves?

299
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,840
Quantum mechanics says it's both.
How could it be both?

300
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,384
- It can't.
- It can't.

301
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,094
But it is.

302
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,514
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

303
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,855
Now...

304
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,734
Thank you.

305
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,486
Mr. Lomanitz.

306
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,570
You're gonna be okay.

307
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,197
Mr. Snyder.

308
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,324
Now let's consider a star.

309
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>A star.</i>

310
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,953
A vast furnace burning in outer space,

311
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,580
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

312
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,832
Balanced.

313
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,501
But if that furnace cools

314
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,588
and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

315
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,756
Density increases.

316
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,467
Correct. Increasing gravity.

317
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,303
- Increasing density.
- And?

318
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,431
It's a vicious cycle until...
What's the limit here?

319
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,226
[chuckles] I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

320
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,811
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

321
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,396
Me?

322
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,940
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

323
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,859
[students laughing]

324
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,652
[Bartlett] <i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

325
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,405
<i>contained details
of his activities in Berkeley.</i>

326
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:19,159
Why would they have started a file
on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

327
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,287
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

328
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,164
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

329
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,958
Uh, my assumption is

330
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:32,714
that it was connected to his,
uh, left-wing political activities.

331
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,424
[door opens]

332
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,761
You shouldn't let them bring up politics
in the classroom, Oppie.

333
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,845
I wrote that.

334
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,057
Lawrence,
you embrace the revolution in physics.

335
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,100
Can't you see it everywhere else?

336
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,269
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

337
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,064
Well, this is America, Oppie.
We had our revolution.

338
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,109
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

339
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,655
Well, out of the lab, my landlady
is having a discussion group tonight.

340
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,740
Interested?

341
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,909
I have sampled
the Berkeley political scene.

342
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:05,372
It's all just philosophy postgrads
and communists talking integration.

343
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,040
You don't care about integration?

344
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,875
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

345
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,210
Especially on a Friday.

346
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,336
Come on. Let's eat.

347
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,921
I'm meeting my brother there.

348
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,384
[Bartlett] And how would these activities
have come to the attention of the FBI?

349
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,469
Well, if I remember correctly,

350
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,640
the FBI was taking license plates
outside suspected communist gatherings,

351
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,392
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

352
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,402
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry.

353
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,070
- Frank.
- Robert.

354
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,697
Uh, you remember Jackie.

355
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,782
Evening.

356
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,700
Let's go.

357
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,870
[people chattering]

358
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,123
[student] Robert.

359
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,500
I want you to meet Chevalier.

360
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,628
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

361
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,712
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

362
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,756
- This is my little brother, Frank.
- Hello.

363
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,383
- And this is-
- Still Jackie.

364
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,509
Hello, Still Jackie.

365
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,553
Chevalier, you're in languages?

366
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,304
And your reputation precedes you.

367
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,389
What have you heard?

368
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,683
That you're teaching
a radical new approach to physics

369
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,061
I have no chance of understanding,
but I hadn't heard you're a Party member.

370
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,688
- I'm not.
- Not yet.

371
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,149
Frank and I are thinking of joining.
Just the other day, I was—

372
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,567
I support a range of causes.

373
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,734
The Spanish Civil War?

374
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,155
A democratic republic being overthrown
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

375
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:23,992
Our government. They think that socialism
is a bigger threat than fascism.

376
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,786
Not for long. Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

377
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,414
I send funds to colleagues in Germany
to emigrate.

378
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,124
I have to do something.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,878
My own work is so abstract.

380
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,465
- What are you working on?
- What happens to stars when they die.

381
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,591
Do stars die?

382
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,429
Well, if they do,
they cool, then collapse.

383
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:49,142
In fact, the bigger the star,
the more violent its demise.

384
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:53,104
Their gravity gets so concentrated,
it swallows everything.

385
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,273
Everything, even light.

386
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,608
Can that really happen?

387
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,318
The math says it can.

388
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,488
If we can get published, then perhaps
one day an astronomer finds one.

389
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,366
But right now, all I have is theory,
which can't impact people's lives.

390
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,494
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

391
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,995
do it through the Communist Party.

392
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,039
They can get it to the front lines.

393
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,415
Mary sent me with these.

394
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:14,375
I'm Jean.

395
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,294
Robert.

396
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,420
Haakon Chevalier.

397
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,422
The union meeting at Serber's last month.

398
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,798
Right, right, yes.

399
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,217
Oh, thank you.

400
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,552
[Chevalier]
Robert here says he's not a communist.

401
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,763
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

402
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,516
I've read <i>Das Kapital</i>, all three volumes.

403
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,600
Does that count?

404
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,894
It would make you better read
than most party members.

405
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,523
It's turgid stuff. There's some thinking,
"Ownership is theft."

406
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,649
"Property."

407
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,067
"Property"?

408
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,401
"Property," not "ownership."

409
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,278
I'm sorry,
I read it in the original German.

410
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,738
[chuckles]

411
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,365
- [Chevalier] Well...
- [glasses clink]

412
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,116
It's not about the book.

413
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,826
It's about the ideas.

414
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,453
And you sound uncommitted.

415
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,831
I'm committed to thinking freely
about how to improve our world.

416
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,626
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

417
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,587
You're a physicist.
You pick and choose rules?

418
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,800
Or do you use the discipline
to channel your energies into progress?

419
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,760
I like a little wiggle room.

420
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,763
Do you always toe the party line?

421
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,183
I like my wiggle room too.

422
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,355
[panting]

423
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:23,945
- What?
- [laughs]

424
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,822
Wait, wait, wait.

425
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,579
- Unexpected.
- What?

426
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,080
For a physicist.

427
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,624
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

428
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,127
Well, actually, my background's more—

429
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,378
Jungian?

430
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,756
You know analysis?

431
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,135
When I was a postgrad at Cambridge,
I had a little trouble.

432
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:49,304
I'll bite.

433
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,930
I tried to poison my tutor.

434
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,015
Did you hate him?

435
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,516
I liked him very much.

436
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,393
You just needed to get laid.

437
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,936
Took my analyst two years,

438
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,147
and I don't think they ever put it
that succinctly.

439
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,067
You have everyone convinced you're
more complicated than you actually are.

440
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,986
We're all simple souls, I guess.

441
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,279
I'm not.

442
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,158
What's this?

443
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,826
Sanskrit.

444
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,077
You can read this?

445
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,746
I'm learning.

446
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,752
Read this.

447
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,257
Well, in this part,
Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self—

448
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,425
No.

449
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,178
Read the words.

450
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,059
"And now I am become Death."

451
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,190
[thunder rumbling]

452
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,816
"The destroyer of worlds."

453
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,112
[wind whistling]

454
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,640
[Oppenheimer] This'll do.

455
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,519
[wind howling]

456
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,606
It'll break before dawn.

457
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,485
Air cools overnight.
Just before dawn, it breaks.

458
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,072
Come on. Come on.

459
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,037
- [chuckles]
- [Lawrence sighs]

460
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,164
[grunts] So...

461
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,624
I'm getting married.

462
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,918
- Frank. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

463
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,002
To Jackie?

464
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,547
- Yeah, to Jackie.
- [Oppenheimer clears throat]

465
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,715
The waitress.

466
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,633
Oppie, you're right. It's lettin' up.

467
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,552
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

468
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:56,889
All your talk about the common man,
but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

469
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,184
We join the Party,
and you can't hide your disapproval, why?

470
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,228
Is that because that's supposed to be
your thing?

471
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,646
I haven't joined the Party, Frank.

472
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,399
And I don't think she should have
convinced you to either.

473
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,025
Half of the faculty is communist.

474
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,110
Not that half.

475
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,322
I'm your brother, Frank,
and I want you to be cautious.

476
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,574
And I want to wring your neck.

477
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,163
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

478
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,418
You're happy, I'm happy.

479
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,254
So then I'm happy you're happy
that I'm happy.

480
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,596
I feel like I could see one of those
dark stars that you're working on.

481
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,557
You can't. That's the whole point.

482
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,726
Their gravity swallows light.

483
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,854
It's like a kind of hole in space.

484
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,064
Is Frank okay?

485
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,817
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

486
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,153
It is special here.

487
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,990
When I was a kid,

488
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,826
I thought if I could find a way

489
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:04,582
to combine physics and New Mexico,

490
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,334
my life would be perfect.

491
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,543
[chuckles]

492
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,338
- Little remote for that.
- Yes.

493
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,173
Let's get some sleep.

494
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,178
That mesa we saw today,
one of my favorite places in the world.

495
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,222
Tomorrow we'll climb it.

496
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,098
[Lawrence] What's it called?

497
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,351
[Oppenheimer] Los Alamos.

498
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,232
I didn't expect to see you today.

499
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,360
Do I have to make an appointment?

500
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,237
[store bell jingles]

501
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,906
- Hey! Hey, get back here!
- Alvarez?

502
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,456
[Alvarez] Oppie! Oppie!

503
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,708
[Oppenheimer] What? What is it?

504
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,919
They've done it. They've done it.

505
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,922
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.
They split the uranium nucleus.

506
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,633
[Lawrence] How?

507
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,719
Bombarded it with neutrons.

508
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,472
It's a nuclear fission.
They did it, they split the atom.

509
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,765
It's not possible.

510
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,898
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

511
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,615
See? Can't be done.

512
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,076
[Lawrence] Very elegant.

513
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,120
Quite clear.

514
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,289
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

515
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,040
Next door.

516
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,709
Alvarez did it.

517
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,919
But then look,

518
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,506
these fission pulses, they're massive.

519
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,594
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

520
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,179
Theory will take you only so far.

521
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,308
During the process,

522
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,897
extra neutrons boil off, which could
be used to split other uranium atoms.

523
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,066
Chain reaction.
You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

524
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,945
You, me, and every other physicist
around the world who's seen the news.

525
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,781
What? What are we all thinking?

526
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,452
A bomb, Alvarez.

527
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,913
A bomb.

528
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,416
I told you, Robert,
no more fucking flowers.

529
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,463
- I don't understand what you want from me.
- I don't want anything from you.

530
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,635
- Well, you say that and then you call.
- Well, don't answer.

531
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,012
I'll always answer.

532
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,437
Fine. Just no more flowers.

533
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,565
You're not coming?

534
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,611
[Chevalier] You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

535
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:42,448
It's not that simple, Hoke.

536
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,951
- Chevalier, good to see you.
- [students] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

537
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,287
Barbara, good to see you,
and the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

538
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,456
- I'm Eltenton.
- Pleasure.

539
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,624
Please, please.

540
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:55,461
Might you say a word
about organized labor on campuses, yes?

541
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,963
Coming through! Coming through.

542
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,339
I work at Shell.

543
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,716
We've signed up chemists,
we signed up engineers,

544
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,468
so why not scientists in academia?

545
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:07,598
[students chanting]
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

546
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,433
[cheering, applauding]

547
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,275
Teachers are unionized.

548
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,404
- Why not professors?
- Don't you have somewhere to be?

549
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,281
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

550
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,242
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

551
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,160
Oh. I'll sit in.

552
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,286
Not this one.

553
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:32,790
[door opens]

554
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,879
Richard. Dr. Bush.
What brings you two up north?

555
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,559
Richard, you tell Ruth
I'll be down to Pasadena Thursday.

556
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,774
[sighs]

557
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,779
Your paper on black holes is in!

558
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,283
Where's Hartland?

559
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,452
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

560
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:13,164
September 1st, 1939.
The world's gonna remember this day.

561
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,582
[chuckles]

562
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,667
Oh, Hartland. Our paper, it's in print.

563
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,627
We've been upstaged.

564
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,674
[Oppenheimer]
<i>During the Battle of Britain,</i>

565
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,677
I found myself
increasingly out of sympathy

566
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:30,890
with the policy of neutrality
that communists advocated.

567
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,060
But after Hitler invaded Russia
and we became allies,

568
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,479
these communist sympathies,
did they return?

569
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,480
No.

570
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:42,526
I need to make clear
that my changing views on Russia

571
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,988
did not mean a sharp break
from those who held different views.

572
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,365
For a year or two,
and during a previous marriage,

573
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,660
my wife Kitty had been
a Communist Party member.

574
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,413
[guests chattering, laughing]

575
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,833
This way.
This is where I keep the good stuff.

576
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,710
I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

577
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,712
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

578
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,715
- Do you two need anything?
- [Oppenheimer] We're good, Ruthie.

579
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,677
So, you're a biologist.

580
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,515
Well, somehow
I have graduated to housewife.

581
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:16,143
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?
Seems baffling.

582
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,728
Yes, it is.

583
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,566
Well, this glass, this drink,

584
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,363
this countertop, uh, our bodies,

585
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,074
all of it.

586
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,410
It's mostly empty space.

587
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,539
Groupings of tiny energy waves
bound together.

588
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,623
By what?

589
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,460
Forces of attraction strong enough
to convince us

590
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:45,965
that matter is solid,
stop my body passing through yours.

591
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,639
[chattering]

592
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,271
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

593
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:01,814
Not very.

594
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,736
There is someone that I feel—

595
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,155
Does she feel the same way?

596
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,614
Sometimes.

597
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,908
Not enough.

598
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,079
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

599
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,999
To my ranch, with friends.
You should come.

600
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,252
I meant with your husband.

601
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,378
Yes, you did.

602
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,881
'Cause you know
it won't make a bit of difference.

603
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,053
[Oppenheimer]
Why did you marry him?

604
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,307
I was lost and he was kind.

605
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,643
Lost?

606
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,062
Well, my previous husband had died

607
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:45,316
and at 28
I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

608
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,817
Who was your first husband?

609
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,112
Nobody. But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

610
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,615
He was, um, from money, like me,

611
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:56,202
but he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

612
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,411
Fell hard.

613
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,871
[chuckles] How hard?

614
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,624
Hard enough to spend the next four years
living off beans and pancakes,

615
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,668
handing out the <i>Daily Worker</i>
at factory gates.

616
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,546
By 36, I just told Joe
I couldn't take it anymore.

617
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,132
Quit the Party.
A year later, I wanted him back.

618
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,801
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker</i>.

619
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,970
He said,
"Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

620
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,430
He went to fight for the Loyalists?

621
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,558
And then he went to the brigades
and I waited, and...

622
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,647
Joe got himself killed first time
he popped his head outta the trench.

623
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,816
Ideology got Joe killed. For nothing.

624
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,693
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

625
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,780
My husband offered both our futures
to stop one fascist bullet

626
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,032
from embedding itself in a mudbank.

627
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,327
That's the definition of nothing.

628
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,287
- Seems a little reductive.
- Pragmatic.

629
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,624
Now here I am.

630
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,836
Wherever the hell this is.

631
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,554
I didn't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

632
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,476
Least you didn't bring me flowers.

633
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,727
[sniffles]

634
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,272
[chuckles]

635
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,319
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

636
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,531
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

637
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,449
No.

638
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,370
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

639
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,332
You knocked her up. Fast work.

640
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,085
- Can't keep a good man down.
- [chuckles]

641
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,378
I meant her.

642
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,382
She knew what she wanted.
What about the husband?

643
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,883
We talked.

644
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,218
They're getting a divorce

645
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:40,472
so we can get married
before she starts showing.

646
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,057
How civilized.

647
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,603
You idiot. This is your community.

648
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,274
You think the rules don't apply
to the golden boy?

649
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,735
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

650
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:57,072
Don't alienate the only people
in the world that understand what you do.

651
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,326
One day you might need them.

652

[students chanting] F-A-E-C-T! F-A-E-C-T!

[Oppenheimer]
The Federation of Architects, Engineers,

655
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,249
Chemists and Technicians.

656
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,509
- Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?
- That's not the point, Lawrence.

657
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:22,431
What do any of you have in common
with farm laborers and dock workers?

658
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,724
[Lomanitz] Plenty.

659
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,935
Everybody out. Now!

660
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,858
Not you.

661
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,735
[footsteps departing]

662
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,821
[door closes]

663
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,698
What are you doing?

664
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,410
- It's a trade union.
- Filled with communists.

665
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,329
So? I haven't joined the Party.

666
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,916
They won't let me bring you
onto the project because of this shit.

667
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,293
They won't even let me tell you
what the project is.

668
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,254
- Oh, I know what the project is.
- Oh, really?

669
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,965
We've all heard about
Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

670
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,675
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

671
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,054
and I know what it means
for the Nazis to have a bomb.

672
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,514
And I don't?

673
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:06,642
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

674
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:07,851
It's mine.

675
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,938
You think that I tell them
about your politics.

676
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,733
The next time you're coming home
from a meeting,

677
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,819
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

678
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:21,782
Listen to the sounds on your phone line
and stop being so goddamn naive.

679
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,576
Why would they care what I do?

680
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,831
Because you're not just self-important,
you're actually important.

681
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,293
Okay.

682
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,464
- I get it.
- If you could just be a little more—

683
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:38,715
Pragmatic.

684
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,759
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others.

685
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,429
You don't have to worry.
It's done, Lawrence.

686
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,185
Then welcome to the war.

687
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,230
I filled out
my first security questionnaire

688
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,525
and was informed that my involvement
with left-wing groups

689
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,529
would not prove a bar
to my working on the atomic program.

690
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,198
[Pastore]
<i>Why were his communist associations</i>

691
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,118
not seen as a security risk
during the war?

692
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,288
Senator, I can't possibly answer
for security clearance

693
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,373
granted years before I ever met the man.

694
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,417
Fine. What about after?

695
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,501
After the war,

696
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:19,214
Dr. Oppenheimer was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

697
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,341
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute.

698
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:24,303
That's why he advised
the Atomic Energy Commission.

699
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,512
Simple as that.

700
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,639
What are they accusing me of?

701
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,768
I think they just wanna know what happened
between 1947 and 1954

702
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,563
to change your mind
on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

703
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,647
I didn't.

704
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,441
I was chair of the AEC,

705
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,903
but it wasn't me
that brought the charges against Robert.

706
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,279
Who did?

707
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,239
Some former staff member
of the Joint Congressional Committee.

708
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,367
He was a rabid anti-communist
named Borden.

709
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,661
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

710
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,247
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC direct?

711
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,833
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

712
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,710
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

713
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,462
This was the McCarthy Era.

714
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,674
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red.

715
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,761
And then,
reading Oppenheimer's security file,

716
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,847
<i>his communist brother,
sister-in-law, fiancée,</i>

717
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,265
<i>best friend, wife.</i>

718
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,768
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

719
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:16,188
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

720
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,190
Because somebody gave it to him.

721
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,735
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

722
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,820
- Who?
- [Strauss] Who knows?

723
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,824
Robert didn't take care not to upset
the power brokers in Washington.

724
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,286
His opinions on the atom became definitive

725
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,872
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

726
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,836
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

727
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,298
There was an AEC vote

728
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,801
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

729
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,554
<i>and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.</i>

730
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:51,557
[congressman] But, Dr. Oppenheimer,
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

731
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,893
that these isotopes
could be useful to our enemies

732
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,395
in the production of atomic weapons.

733
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,648
Congressmen, you could use
a shovel in making atomic weapons.

734
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,732
In fact, you do.

735
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,860
You could use a bottle of beer
in making atomic weapons.

736
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,320
In fact, you do.

737
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,740
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components,

738
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,994
- but more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughs]

739
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,123
[Strauss]
<i>Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.</i>

740
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,793
How could this man
who saw so much be so blind?

741

[baby continues crying]

744
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:36,768
Kitty?

745
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,606
Kitty, the project—

746
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,651
I'm in. I'm in.

747
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,028
Let's celebrate.

748
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,535
Shouldn't you go to him?

749
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,543
I have been going to him all fucking day.

750
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,925
[baby continues crying]

00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,931
[engine turns off]

752
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,308
Okay.

753
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,478
- [baby continues crying]
- [knocks on door]

754
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,733
Here.

755
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,443
Come here, darling.

756
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,862
I don't know how to say this.

757
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,573
I-I'm ashamed to ask.

758
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,158
[Chevalier] Anything.

759
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,036
- Take Peter.
- Sure.

760
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,954
No, for a while, Hoke.

761
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:39,915
A while.

762
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,086
Does Kitty know you're here?

763
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,379
Yes, of course she knows.

764
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,673
Of course she knows.

765
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,093
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

766
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:54,388
Forget I asked.

767
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,390
Selfish, awful people,

768
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,809
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

769
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,103
Sit, sit, sit.

770
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,483
Robert, you see beyond the world
we live in.

771
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,237
There is a price to be paid for that.

772
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,280
Of course we'll help you.

773
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,252
[Kitty] Everything's changing, Robert.

774
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,462
Having a child
was always going to change—

775
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:31,091
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

776
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,301
It's reforming.

777
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,013
This is your moment.

778
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,267
We're putting together a group
to study feasibili—

779
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,103
"We" shouldn't be doing anything.
You should.

780
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,605
Lawrence won't get this done.

781
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,483
Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will.

782
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:53,655
[chattering]

783
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,327
[Oppenheimer] Who are the uniforms?

784
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:01,580
I thought you might know.

785
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,791
- [door opens]
- [colonel] Dr. Oppenheimer.

786
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,502
I'm Colonel Groves.

787
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,713
This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

788
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,047
Have that dry cleaned.

789
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:19,139
Well, if that's how
you treat Lieutenant Colonel,

790
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,768
I'd hate to see how you treat
a humble physicist.

791
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,644
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

792
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,146
[chuckles] Ouch.

793
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,775
Theaters of combat all over the world
but I have to stay in Washington.

794
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,611
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

795
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:37,115
The brass likes it so much they made me
take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

796
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,617
Which is?

797
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:40,744
Don't be a smart ass.

798
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:41,995
You know damn well what it is.

799
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,539
You and half of every physics department
across the country.

800
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:46,500
That's problem number one.

801
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,628
I thought problem number one
would be securing enough uranium ore.

802
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:53,256
- 1,200 tons bought the day I took charge.
- Processing?

803
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,675
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

804
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,470
Now I'm looking for a project director.

805
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:00,639
And my name came up?

806
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,807
Nope.

807
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,185
Even though you brought quantum physics
to America.

808
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,478
Which made me curious.

809
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,271
What've you found out?

810
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:13,235
You're a dilettante, a womanizer,
a suspected communist—

811
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,611
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

812
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,363
I said "suspected."

813
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:20,492
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic—

814
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,411
Nothing good, no?
Not even, "He's brilliant, but—"

815
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,873
Well, brilliance is taken for granted
in your circle, so no.

816
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,627
No, the only person who had anything good
to say was Richard Tolman.

817
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,629
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

818
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:37,133
but he also strikes me as a guy
who knows more about science than people.

819
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,969
Yet here you are.

820
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,137
You don't take much on trust.

821
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:42,889
I don't take anything on trust.

822
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,436
Why don't you have a Nobel prize?

823
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,897
- Why aren't you a general?
- They're making me one for this.

824
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:53,942
- Perhaps I'll have the same luck.
- A Nobel prize for making a bomb?

825
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,902
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

826
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,990
So how would you proceed?

827
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:06,621
You're talking about turning theory
into a practical weapons system

828
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:07,998
faster than the Nazis.

829
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:09,583
Who have a 12-month head start.

830
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,751
- Eighteen.
- How could you possibly know that?

831
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,296
Our fast neutron research took six months.

832
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:17,257
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge
will have made that leap instantly.

833
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,718
- Who do you think they put in charge?
- Werner Heisenberg.

834
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:24,055
He has the most intuitive understanding
of atomic structure I have ever seen.

835
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:25,640
- You know his work?
- I know him.

836
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,393
Just like I know Walther Bothe,
Von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

837
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,228
In a straight race, the Germans win.

838
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:31,396
We've got one hope.

839
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,689
Which is?

840
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:35,066
Anti-Semitism.

841
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:37,527
What?

842
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:40,363
Hitler called quantum physics
"Jewish science."

843
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,781
Said it right to Einstein's face.

844
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,660
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so, so blinded by hate

845
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,412
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

846
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,331
because it'll take vast resources.

847
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,957
Our nation's best scientists,
working together.

848
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,208
Right now, they're scattered.

849
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,085
Which gives us compartmentalization.

850
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,088
All minds have to see the whole task
to contribute efficiently.

851
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,341
Poor security may cost us the race.

852
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,717
Inefficiency will.

853
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,219
The Germans know more than us anyway.

854
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:04,763
The Russians don't.

855
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,392
Remind me, who are we at war with?

856
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:12,729
Somebody with your past
doesn't wanna be seen downplaying

857
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,191
the importance of security
from our communist allies.

858
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,027
Point taken. But, no.

859
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,196
You don't get to say "no" to me.

860
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,448
It's my job to say
"no" to you when you're wrong.

861
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,492
So you have the job now?

862
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,577
Uh, I'm considering it.

863
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,874
I'm starting to see
where you got your reputation.

864
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,627
My favorite response?

865
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:38,713
"Oppenheimer couldn't run
a hamburger stand."

866
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,591
[chuckles] I couldn't.

867
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,637
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

868
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,015
There's a way to balance these things.

869
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:53,103
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley
under Lawrence.

870
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,271
Met Lab in Chicago under Szilard.

871
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,732
Large scale refining,
where did you say? Tennessee.

872
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,401
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

873
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,904
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

874
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,073
connected by rail.

875
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,658
Focused on one goal.

876
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,243
One point in space and time.

877
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,452
And it comes together here.

878
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,954
<i>A secret laboratory.</i>

879
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,206
<i>In the middle of nowhere,
secure, self-sufficient,</i>

880
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,874
equipment, housing, the works.

881
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,543
Keep everyone there until it's done.

882
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,963
- I'll need the schools, stores, a church.
- Why?

883
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,174
If we don't let scientists bring
their families, we'll never get the best.

884
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:26,011
You want security,
build a town, build it fast.

885
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,470
Where?

886
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,767
Welcome to Los Alamos.

887
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,520
Now, there's a boys' school
we'll have to commandeer

888
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,313
and the local Indians
come up here for burial rites.

889
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,190
But, apart from that, nothing.

890
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,692
Forty miles. Any direction.

891
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,652
Enough to find the perfect spot.

892
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,863
- What for?
- Success.

893
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,287
Build him a town. Fast.

894
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,207
Let's go recruit some scientists.

895
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,919
- Why would I leave my family?
- I told you, you can bring your family.

896
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,379
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

897
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:03,590
A soldier? He's a general.

898
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,341
I've got all the soldier I need.

899
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,385
What can I tell them?

900
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,387
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe, Bohr.

901
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,847
What do these men have in common?

902
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,640
The greatest minds on atomic theory.

903
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,225
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

904
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,061
As much as you like...

905
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:19,189
until you feel my boot on your balls.

906
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,441
You know isotopes

907
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,860
and you know explosives,
better than anyone in the world.

908
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,528
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

909
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,743
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

910
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,953
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

911
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:35,872
Did they stop printing newspapers
in Princeton?

912
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:39,709
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere
for who knows how long?

913
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:41,544
A year or two. Or three.

914
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,882
General, could you give us a moment?

915
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,011
It's about unleashing the strong force

916
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,014
before the Nazis do.

917
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:54,974
Oh, my God.

918
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:57,352
- Niels won't work for the Nazis.
- No, never.

919
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,687
But while they have him, we don't.

920
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,939
That's why I need you.

921
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,941
Why would you think I'd do that?

922
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,943
Why? Why?

923
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,153
How about because this is
the most important fucking thing

924
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,280
to ever happen in the history
of the world.

925
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,825
How about that? Fuck.

926
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,290
They are not gonna let me
onto this project.

927
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:23,795
And failing a security check is not gonna
be good for a career, even after the war.

928
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,505
So you're a fellow traveler.

929
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,133
So what? This is a national emergency.

930
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:31,261
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

931
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,345
They need us.

932
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,888
Until they don't.

933
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,186
Is there any chance
of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

934
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,396
[Groves] Nah, no dice.

935
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,648
I checked with the British.

936
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,733
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

937
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,776
there's just no way.

938
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,779
Is he that important?

939
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:52,907
How many people do you know
who've proved Einstein wrong?

940
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,202
You know, it really would be quicker
to take a plane.

941
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,829
No, plane's too risky.

942
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,289
Country needs us.

943
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,000
[construction equipment whirring]

944
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:06,129
The Harvard guys, they say the building's
too small for the cyclotron.

945
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,425
Get them together with the architects.

946
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,722
When's this place supposed to open?

947
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:19,893
Two months.

948
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,355
Robert, you're the great improviser,
but this...

949
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,733
you can't do in your head.

950
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,569
Four divisions.

951
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,157
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

952
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,325
Who's running Theoretical?

953
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,618
I am.

954
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:39,537
That's what I was afraid of.
You're spread too thin.

955
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:42,373
So you take Theoretical.

956
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,879
I'm not coming here, Robert.

957
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,053
Why not?

958
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:05,563
You drop a bomb
and it falls on the just, and the unjust.

959
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,525
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

960
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,527
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

961
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,497
Izzy.

962
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,669
I don't know if we can be trusted
with such a weapon.

963
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:32,215
But I know the Nazis can't.

964
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:37,553
We have no choice.

965
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,432
Then...

966
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,895
the second thing you'll have to do
is appoint Hans Bethe

967
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,689
to run the theoretical division.

968
00:51:49,983 --> 00:51:51,901
Wait, what was the first?

969
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:55,488
Take off that ridiculous uniform.
You're a scientist.

970
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,573
Groves is insisting we join.

971
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,659
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

972
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,786
They need us for who we are.

973
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,372
So be yourself. Only better.

974
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,247
- This is the only key.
- [keys jangle]

975
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:49,500
And Teller's already here.
Shall I just show him in?

976
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,628
- No, let's wait for the others.
- [door opens]

977
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,261
Let's get started.

978
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:02,388
Hello, Edward.

979
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:03,514
Yes.

980
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:05,933
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

981
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,811
until the T-section at Los Alamos
is finished.

982
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:09,896
Edward, can I please—

983
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:11,189
It is more important.

984
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:17,362
When I calculated the chain reaction,
I found a rather troubling possibility.

985
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:21,032
No. This can't be right.

986
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,368
Show me how you did your calculations.

987
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,452
[Edward] Yes.

988
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:31,542
- It's exponential.
- No. No, no, no. No.

989
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,506
This is fantasy.

990
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,633
Teller's calculations can't be right.

991
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,469
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

992
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,554
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

993
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,932
There's not much common ground
between you two.

994
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,433
That's why I should get his view.

995
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,440
- Albert.
- Mmm?

996
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:57,360
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer. [chuckles]

997
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,530
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?
We walk here most days.

998
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:04,617
Trees are the most inspiring structures.

999
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,744
Albert, might I have a word?

1000
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,539
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

1001
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,210
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1002
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,420
Even in Princeton.

1003
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:18,840
He's convinced that the Nazis
can poison his food.

1004
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:21,384
Hmm?

1005
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,721
Wha—

1006
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,062
Whose— Whose work is this?

1007
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,313
Teller's.

1008
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,108
What do you take it to mean?

1009
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,610
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1010
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:43,030
releasing neutrons
to smash into other nuclei.

1011
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,201
Criticality, a point of no return,
massive explosive force.

1012
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,912
But this time,
the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1013
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,207
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1014
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:56,961
When we detonate an atomic device,

1015
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,130
we might start a chain reaction that...

1016
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,883
destroys the world.

1017
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,594
So here we are, hmm?

1018
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:09,015
Lost in your quantum world
of probabilities

1019
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,433
and needing certainty.

1020
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,686
Can you run the calculations yourself?

1021
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:18,649
About the only thing you and I have
in common is a disdain for mathematics.

1022
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:21,903
- Who's working on this in Berkeley?
- Hans Bethe.

1023
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,238
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1024
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,159
And if the truth is catastrophic?

1025
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:30,077
Then you stop.

1026
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,122
And you share your findings
with the Nazis.

1027
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,417
So neither side destroys the world.

1028
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,255
Robert.

1029
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,884
This is yours, not mine.

1030
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,274
[Bethe] Teller's wrong.

1031
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,193
- He's wrong.
- Shh, shh, shh...

1032
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,778
[keys jangling]

1033
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,113
[lock clicks]

1034
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,535
[lock clicks]

1035
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,829
[Bethe] When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

1036
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,206
the real picture emerges.

1037
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,374
Bottom line?

1038
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,211
The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction are near zero.

1039
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,587
Near zero.

1040
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,465
Oppie, this is good news.

1041
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,591
Mmm.

1042
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:29,637
- Can you run them again?
- No, you'll get the same answer.

1043
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,305
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1044
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,849
the best assurance
you're going to get is this.

1045
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:34,934
Near zero.

1046
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,314
- [sighs] Theory will take you only so far.
- Mmm.

1047
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,734
- [Chevalier] Hello!
- Hello, you. We missed him.

1048
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:46,529
- You want to adopt?
- She's kidding.

1049
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,239
We wanted to see you before we left.

1050
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,200
For parts unknown.

1051
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:55,663
You know who I ran into
the other day? Eltenton.

1052
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,582
[Oppenheimer] Huh.

1053
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,001
The chemist from Shell? The union guy?

1054
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,628
[Chevalier] Yeah. The FAECT guy.

1055
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,257
He was moaning
about how we're handling the war.

1056
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:08,801
How so?

1057
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,762
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

1058
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:15,975
Apparently our government's not sharing
any research with the Russians.

1059
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:19,854
Well, he said, "Most scientists
think the policy is stupid."

1060
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,151
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1061
00:57:25,735 --> 00:57:29,822
He mentioned that if anyone
had anything they wanted to pass on,

1062
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:34,243
going around official channels,
that he could help.

1063
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,211
That would be treason.

1064
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,797
Yes, of course.

1065
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,175
I just thought you should know.

1066
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,181
The brat is down.
Where are the martinis?

1067
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,063
Coming right up.

1068
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,606
[Oppenheimer]
<i>The conversation ended there.</i>

1069
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,942
Nothing in our long-standing friendship
would have led me to believe

1070
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:09,987
that Chevalier
was actually seeking information,

1071
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:14,575
and I am certain that he had no idea
of the work in which I was engaged.

1072
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:20,998
It has long been clear to me

1073
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:24,168
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1074
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,962
[McGee] <i>The Oppenheimer situation
highlights the tension</i>

1075
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:30,299
between scientists
and the security apparatus.

1076
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:32,718
In hopes of learning how the nominee
handled such issues

1077
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,845
during his time at the AEC,

1078
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:37,682
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1079
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,352
- Who are they bringing in?
- They haven't said.

1080
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,645
Mr. Chairman, if I may,

1081
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,314
I'm nominated for commerce secretary.

1082
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:47,608
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

1083
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,902
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1084
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,697
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1085
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,032
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying,

1086
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:56,534
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1087
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,786
This is not a court.

1088
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,163
Formality, huh?

1089
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,959
No presidential Cabinet nominee
has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1090
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,211
This is just how the game is played.

1091
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,672
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

1092
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,966
<i>They bring in a scientist, so what?</i>

1093
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,926
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1094
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,178
They resent anyone
who questions their judgment,

1095
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:18,222
<i>especially if you're not one of them.</i>

1096
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,765
I was chair of the AEC.

1097
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,934
I'm easy to blame
for what happened to Robert.

1098
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,270
We can't have the Senate
thinking the scientific community

1099
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,813
doesn't support you, sir.

1100
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,899
- Or should we pivot?
- [Senate aide] To what?

1101
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:30,443
And embrace it.

1102
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:33,154
"I fought Oppenheimer and the US won."

1103
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:34,822
I-I don't think we need to go there.

1104
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,991
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1105
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,659
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

1106
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,578
Can you get the name of the scientist
they've called?

1107
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:41,537
Probably.

1108
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,665
Find out if he was based in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.

1109
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:45,958
Why does that matter?

1110
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,753
If he was based in Chicago,
he worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1111
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,880
not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.

1112
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,423
Robert built that damn place.

1113
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:56,510
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,
all rolled into one.

1114
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,936
- [officer chattering on loudspeaker]
- [Peter crying]

1115
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,858
All it needs is a saloon.

1116
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,318
[Peter continues crying]

1117

[murmurs]

1118
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,678
Let's go and see.

1119
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,806
There's no kitchen.

1120
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:45,309
Really? We'll fix that.

1121
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,237
Barbed wire? Guns? Oppie.

1122
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,322
[Oppenheimer] We're at war, Hans.

1123
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:03,494
Halifax, 1917.

1124
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,163
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1125
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,627
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1126
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,133
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1127
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:21,554
Now let's calculate how much more
destructive it would have been

1128
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:25,224
if it were a nuclear,
and not a chemical, reaction.

1129
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,269
Expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1130
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,770
But it will be thousands.

1131
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,940
Well, then... kilotons.

1132
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:41,323
- Using U-235, the bomb will need-
- Ah...

1133
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,450
Right, sorry.

1134
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:47,413
Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere
about this size.

1135
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:51,125
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1136
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:56,672
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge
refined all of last month.

1137
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:03,387
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1138
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:09,435
Now, if we can enrich these amounts,
we need a way to detonate them.

1139
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,686
[paper rips]

1140
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,146
Are we boring you, Edward?

1141
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,356
A little bit, yes.

1142
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,774
May I ask why?

1143
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:19,153
We all entered this room
knowing a fission bomb was possible.

1144
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:22,865
- How about we leave it with something new?
- Such as?

1145
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:26,660
Instead of uranium or plutonium,
we use hydrogen.

1146
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:27,870
[all murmuring]

1147
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,413
Heavy hydrogen.

1148
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,081
Deuterium.

1149
01:02:31,582 --> 01:02:32,625
You see?

1150
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:35,377
We compact the atoms together
under great pressure

1151
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,379
to induce a fusion reaction.

1152
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:41,091
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1153
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,259
but megatons.

1154
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:45,179
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1155
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:49,141
So how do you generate enough force
to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1156
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,727
A small fission bomb.

1157
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,604
- Ah...
- There we are!

1158
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,481
[applause, laughter]

1159
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:57,149
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1160
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,193
can we get back to the business at hand?

1161
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,444
[Bartlett] The isotopes issue

1162
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:05,532
wasn't your most important policy
disagreement with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1163
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:08,160
it was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1164
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:13,374
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree
on a great many things, uh,

1165
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:17,252
and, well, one of them was the need
for an H-bomb program, yes.

1166
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,213
[siren wailing]

1167
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:33,268
[Strauss]
Thanks for convening on short notice.

1168
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,770
I can't believe it.

1169
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,314
Here we are.

1170
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,358
Catch me up. What do we know?

1171
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:43,529
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific
has detected radiation.

1172
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,197
Do we have the filter paper?

1173
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,158
- There's no doubt what this is.
- White House says there's a doubt.

1174
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,660
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1175
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,538
Are those the long-range detection
filter papers?

1176
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:54,832
It's an atomic test.

1177
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,212
The Russians have a bomb.

1178
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,632
We're supposed to be years ahead of them,
but some—

1179
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:07,136
What were you guys doing at Los Alamos?
Wasn't security tight?

1180
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,888
- Of course it was. You weren't there.
- [Nichols] Forgive me, Doctor...

1181
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,183
but I was there.

1182
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:17,771
We can now consider
the actual mechanics of detonation.

1183
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,148
[Oppenheimer] Any ideas?

1184
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,566
[Serber] I call this "shooting."

1185
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:24,278
We fire a chunk of fissionable material
into a larger sphere

1186
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,905
with enough force to achieve criticality.

1187
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,699
What do we think? Anyone?

1188
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,451
[Tolman]
I've been thinking about implosion.

1189
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,537
Explosives around the sphere
blast inwards, crushing the material.

1190
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,457
I'd like to investigate that idea.

1191
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,709
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1192
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,920
- [Groves] Progress?
- Nice to see you too.

1193
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,673
Meet the British contingent.

1194
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:46,425
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1195
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,302
How long have you been British?

1196
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,554
- Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.
- Aha.

1197
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:52,931
Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1198
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:55,225
School's up and running.

1199
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,311
Bar... always running.

1200
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,522
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1201
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,776
- Is that-
- [Oppenheimer] Mrs. Serber, yes.

1202
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:07,321
I've offered jobs to all the wives.
Admin, librarians, computation.

1203
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,531
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1204
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:10,783
Are these women qualified?

1205
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,952
Don't be absurd. These are some
of the brightest minds in our community.

1206
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,746
And they're already security cleared.

1207
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,830
I've informed General Groves

1208
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,374
you've been holding cross-divisional,
open discussions on a nightly basis.

1209
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:20,709
Shut them down.

1210
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:23,378
Compartmentalization is the key
to maintaining security—

1211
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:24,379
[Condon] It's only the top men.

1212
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,423
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1213
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,383
These men aren't stupid.
They can be discreet.

1214
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:29,426
I don't like it.

1215
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,179
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

1216
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,604
Once a week. Top men only.

1217
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,107
- I'd like to bring my brother here.
- No.

1218
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:45,776
Nichols...

1219
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,947
I still haven't heard that
my security clearance has been approved.

1220
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,949
- It hasn't.
- We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1221
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,700
Well, you should wait.

1222
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:56,328
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start?

1223
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,247
Dr. Oppenheimer,
the fact that your security clearance

1224
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:00,374
is proving difficult to obtain
is not my fault.

1225
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,792
It's yours.

1226
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,544
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1227
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,087
Because I'm going.

1228
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,297
[Strauss]
And how many people were in these, uh,

1229
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,883
open discussions?

1230
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,302
Too many. Compartmentalization
was supposed to be the protocol.

1231
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,179
We were in a race against the Nazis.

1232
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:17,474
- And now the race is against the Soviets.
- Not unless we start it.

1233
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:21,603
Robert, they just fired a starting gun.

1234
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:23,897
What's the nature of the device
they detonated?

1235
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:27,484
The data indicates it may have been
a plutonium implosion device.

1236
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:30,696
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1237
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,699
The Russians have a bomb,
Truman needs to know what's next.

1238
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,659
What's next? Arms talks.

1239
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,202
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

1240
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:39,663
What about the Super?

1241
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,375
Does Truman even know about it?
Did we brief him on that?

1242
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,543
Not specifically.

1243
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,588
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

1244
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,756
My understanding
is that Teller proposed it?

1245
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,425
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

1246
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,468
Teller's designs have
always been wildly impractical.

1247
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,554
You'd have to deliver by ox cart.

1248
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,556
- Not airplane.
- [Lawrence] Oppie.

1249
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,892
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence.
Do you want to comment?

1250
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:02,769
No.

1251
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:07,024
Because if it can put us ahead again,

1252
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:12,196
the President of the United States
needs to know about it.

1253
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:13,697
[scoffs]

1254
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,660
And if the Russians know about it already
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1255
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:19,745
then we've gotta get going.

1256
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,748
There's no proof
there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1257
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:23,832
Robert.

1258
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,547
They put it under the football stadium?

1259
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:32,507
The field's not in use anymore.

1260
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,842
Just as well.

1261
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,513
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

1262
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,682
<i>Come stai? Va bene?</i>

1263
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,353
- I hear you got a little town.
- Yes. Come and see.

1264
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:45,437
[Szilard chuckles]

1265
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,774
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1266
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,652
Everybody will go crazy.

1267
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:54,780
Thank you for the vote of confidence,
Szilard.

1268
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,700
Do we really—
Do we really need that in the notes?

1269
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,453
When are you going to try it out?

1270
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,205
We did.

1271
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,541
[Fermi] The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1272
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,710
Didn't Groves tell you?

1273
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,462
- [Geiger counter humming]
- No.

1274
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:17,678
[soldier] One at a time, please.
One at a time.

1275
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,471
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1276
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,225
I tried Personnel.
They asked if I could type.

1277
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,476
Can you?

1278
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,187
Harvard forgot to teach that
on the graduate chemistry course.

1279
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,733
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here
on the plutonium team.

1280
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,408
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

1281
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,701
Visiting the Met?

1282
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:41,827
Why?

1283
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,954
- Why?
- Because we have every right-

1284
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,708
You have just the rights that I give you.
No more, no less.

1285
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,210
We are adults
trying to run a project here.

1286
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:51,837
This is ridiculous.

1287
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,921
Tell him.

1288
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:57,301
Compartmentalization
is the protocol we agreed to.

1289
01:08:58,552 --> 01:08:59,761
Enough of this madhouse.

1290
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,763
Nobody can work under these conditions.

1291
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,725
You know what, Generalissimo?

1292
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,184
I quit.

1293
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,477
Thanks for nothing.

1294
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,273
[Groves] Better off without him.

1295
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:12,399
[door slams]

1296
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:15,527
Aren't you more concerned
about his discretion out there?

1297
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,113
We'll have him killed.

1298
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,408
I was just kidding. [chuckles]

1299
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:23,785
No, he hates me, not America.

1300
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,331
You know, General,
not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1301
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,749
I don't think I understand.

1302
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,418
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past,

1303
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,086
you hired me because of it.

1304
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,006
So you could control me.

1305
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,675
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1306
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:40,260
I'm just a humble soldier.

1307
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,346
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier.

1308
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:45,182
- You studied engineering at MIT.
- Guilty as charged.

1309
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:46,600
Well, now we understand each other,

1310
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:48,268
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1311
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,437
so I can perform this miracle for you.

1312
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,695
[attorney] <i>General Groves,
were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's</i>

1313
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:01,239
<i>left-wing associations
when you appointed him?</i>

1314
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,408
[Groves] I was aware
that there were suspicions about him.

1315
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:06,578
I was aware he had
a very extreme, liberal background.

1316
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:09,623
In your opinion, would he ever
consciously commit a disloyal act?

1317
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,625
I would be amazed if he did.

1318
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,503
[attorney] So you had
complete confidence in his integrity?

1319
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:17,172
At Los Alamos, yes,
which is where I really knew him.

1320
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,925
General, did your security officers
on the project

1321
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:22,260
advise you against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1322
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:26,306
They could not and would not clear him
until I insisted.

1323
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,058
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1324
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,851
of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file.

1325
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,019
I did.

1326
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:34,189
There's only really one question
I need answered here today.

1327
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:38,860
In light of the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1328
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,737
Do you have the guidelines?

1329
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:53,959
[Robb] Under current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1330
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:57,838
- [rooster crows]
- [car approaching]

1331
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:05,053
[car door opens, closes]

1332
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,431
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1333
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,765
[chuckles]

1334
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:09,850
My God.

1335
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,893
What a trek.

1336
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,311
That's why you need a liaison.

1337
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:14,771
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1338
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,065
You're gonna be okay.

1339
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,400
This way, gentlemen.

1340
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:22,362
[beakers clinking]

1341
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:24,281
[gas hissing]

1342
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:30,245
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1343
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,789
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1344
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:34,749
Compartmentalization.
I understand completely.

1345
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:39,379
[chattering]

1346
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:41,673
Thank you.

1347
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,513
[all cheering]

1348
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,475
[Lawrence] <i>Greetings from Berkeley.</i>

1349
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,895
I am here to update you on our progress
and solicit your input.

1350
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,189
To do so,
I am going to have to share a few things

1351
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:59,941
that General Groves told me not to.

1352
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:02,861
Sorry, General, I said I understood,
not that I agreed.

1353
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:04,446
- [all chuckling]
- [Lawrence] Okay.

1354
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,072
Gentlemen, to business.

1355
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,201
There were rumors of espionage
at Los Alamos.

1356
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:10,410
Unsubstantiated.

1357
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:13,580
[Strauss] I'm told that there
were communists on the project.

1358
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,916
We didn't knowingly employ
any communists.

1359
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,335
Were any of them involved
in discussions of the Super?

1360
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:21,004
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1361
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,756
My brother had left the Party by then.

1362
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:23,840
What about Lomanitz?

1363
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:26,885
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.
He was a liaison.

1364
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,763
Our security was tight,
as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1365
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:32,557
Our security was as tight as it could be
given the personalities involved,

1366
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,892
but attempts were made.

1367
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,811
- What is that supposed to mean?
- We've all read his file here.

1368
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:39,814
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

1369
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:42,943
Or the Chevalier incident?

1370
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:48,448
Excuse me.

1371
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:53,245
- [phone ringing]
- [secretary] That's Lomanitz, on line one.

1372
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:00,961
Hello, Rossi.

1373
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:04,047
<i>What? Okay, just calm down.</i>

1374
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,383
There's been another screw-up.

1375
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,134
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1376
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:10,845
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1377
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,931
We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

1378
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,391
It wasn't a mistake.

1379
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:17,269
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1380
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,979
He promised to quit all that.

1381
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,438
Well, he hasn't.

1382
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,234
Security officer at Berkeley's
concerned about communist infiltration

1383
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,152
through that union, the FA—

1384
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,071
FAECT.

1385
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:32,784
Well, I'm there next week, I'll...

1386
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:34,202
drop in to see him.

1387
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:37,831
Your Q clearance came through.

1388
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:45,255
It's important you not maintain or renew
any questionable associations.

1389
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,178
[Robb]
<i>Doctor, did you think social contacts</i>

1390
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:56,349
between a person engaged on secret
war work and communists was dangerous?

1391
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,436
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1392
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:03,023
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1393
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,318
<i>you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous?</i>

1394
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:12,657
[elevator bell dings]

1395
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:15,076
[Oppenheimer]
<i>Were conceivably dangerous, yes.</i>

1396
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:19,289
[Robb] <i>I mean, really? Known communists?</i>

1397
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,251
[Oppenheimer] <i>Look...</i>

1398
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:28,590
I've had a lot of secrets in my head
for a long time.

1399
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:34,012
Doesn't matter who I associate with.
I don't talk about those secrets.

1400
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,271
[Robb] You said in your statement

1401
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:45,482
that you had

1402
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,902
to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1403
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,072
You left.

1404
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:54,699
Not a word.

1405
01:14:55,367 --> 01:14:57,369
What did you think that would do to me?

1406
01:14:58,662 --> 01:14:59,663
I wrote.

1407
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,748
Pages of nothing.

1408
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,002
Where did you go?

1409
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,214
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

1410
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,840
Because you're a communist.

1411
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:15,470
Why did you have to see her?

1412
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:20,308
Because she had indicated a great desire
to see me before we left.

1413
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:25,021
At that time, I couldn't,
but I felt that she had to see me.

1414
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:27,774
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment.

1415
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,901
She was extremely unhappy.

1416
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,195
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1417
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,244
Because she was still in love with me.

1418
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,378
Spent the night together, didn't you?

1419
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:57,512
[Oppenheimer] Yes.

1420
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:06,938
You drop in and out of my life

1421
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,482
and you don't have to tell me why.

1422
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,942
Now, that's power.

1423
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,069
Not that I enjoy.

1424
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,281
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1425
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:18,783
But you have other priorities now.

1426
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,369
I have a wife and child.

1427
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,081
That's not what either of us
is talking about.

1428
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:29,878
Jean.

1429
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:32,297
You asked me to come.

1430
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:35,049
And I'm glad I did.

1431
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,594
But I can't see you again.

1432
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,599
But what if I need you?

1433
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,563
You said you would always answer.

1434
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,692
Not a word.

1435
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:56,154
[Robb] Did you think that consistent
with good security?

1436
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:59,115
- [rhythmic thudding]
- As a matter of fact, it was. Not a word.

1437
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,617
[thudding intensifies]

1438
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,410
[Robb] When did you see her after that?

1439
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,084
[thudding stops]

1440
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:12,253
I never saw her again.

1441
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,221
I can make the last train
back to Princeton.

1442
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,516
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1443
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:27,769
- Today you said it to history, didn't you?
- This is a closed hearing.

1444
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,565
If they don't release the transcript,
I'm sure you will.

1445
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:33,650
I was under oath.

1446
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:36,736
Well, you were under an oath to me
when you went to see Jean.

1447
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,155
You know, you...

1448
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,449
you sit there,

1449
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:42,534
day after day,

1450
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,995
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1451
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,874
Why won't you fight?

1452
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,130
[attorney]
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

1453
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:04,597
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.
Please, take a seat.

1454
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:06,474
No need, I just wanted to check

1455
01:18:06,558 --> 01:18:10,520
whether I should talk to Lomanitz
while I'm here, given your concerns.

1456
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,481
Well, I'd say that's really up to you,
Professor, but I'd be cautious.

1457
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:14,899
Uh-huh. Understood.

1458
01:18:14,983 --> 01:18:17,527
Oh, and, um... [clears throat]... as regards to the union,

1459
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,155
I wanted to give you a heads-up
on a man named Eltenton.

1460
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:22,782
- A heads-up?
- Yes.

1461
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:25,702
Just that he might merit watching, is all.

1462
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,621
I'd love to get more details.

1463
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:32,041
Well, I have an appointment now,
and I leave early tomorrow.

1464
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,712
Well, come back as early as you like.
Since you haven't time now.

1465
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,506
You went back the next morning.

1466
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,550
I did. I had to, really.

1467
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,760
<i>This time there was another man.</i>

1468
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:46,347
He said his name was Pash.

1469
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:49,017
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1470
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,230
[Robb] Colonel Pash, could you please read
from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1471
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:58,443
[Pash] "Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1472
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:01,404
indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1473
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,823
Subject met with,
and spent considerable time with,

1474
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,783
one Jean Tatlock, communist,

1475
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,285
the record of whom is attached."

1476
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,954
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer?
- [Pash] Yes.

1477
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,706
[Robb] Whom you had not met?

1478
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,124
[Pash] Not then, but soon after.

1479
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,752
He's the head of security for the project.
Shouldn't I know him?

1480
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:19,380
No, he should know you.
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1481
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:20,423
Why not?

1482
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,884
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

1483
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,887
he told the FBI he was gonna kidnap him,

1484
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,722
take him out on a boat,

1485
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,183
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1486
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,396
General Groves has placed in me
a certain responsibility,

1487
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,649
and it's like having a child
who I can't see.

1488
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,026
By remote control.

1489
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:42,737
So to actually meet you is...

1490
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,950
- I won't take up too much of your time.
- No, not at all.

1491
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:48,242
Whatever time you choose.

1492
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:51,621
Mr. Johnson told me of a conversation
you had yesterday

1493
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,997
in which I'm very interested.

1494
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:55,291
It's had me worried all day.

1495
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:58,920
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk
to Lomanitz without authorization.

1496
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,922
That's not the particular interest
that I have.

1497
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:02,465
It's something a little bit more...

1498
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,426
in my opinion, more serious.

1499
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,304
Now, when the FBI pointed out
that such information

1500
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,722
wouldn't be admissible in court,

1501
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:13,935
Pash made it clear he had no intention
of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1502
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:17,105
Now, the FBI talked him down,
but that's the man you're dancing with.

1503
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,899
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1504
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:21,985
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab?

1505
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:29,450
A man attached to the Soviet Consul
indicated through intermediate people

1506
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:34,580
to people on this project that he was
in a position to transmit information.

1507
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:37,041
Why would anyone on the project
wanna do that?

1508
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,295
Frankly, I can see
that there might be an argument

1509
01:20:41,379 --> 01:20:43,756
for the commander-in-chief
informing the Russians.

1510
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,842
They're our allies after all.

1511
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,720
But I don't like the idea
of it going out the back door.

1512
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:51,014
It might not hurt
to be on the lookout for it.

1513
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,017
And you said that to Pash?

1514
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,312
I was trying to put it in the context
of "Russia's not Germany."

1515
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:02,900
Boris Pash is the son
of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1516
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,902
Born here, but in 1918,

1517
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,405
he went back to Russia
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1518
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:10,324
This is a man who has killed communists
with his own hands.

1519
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:13,536
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1520
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,205
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1521
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:18,166
Would you be a little more specific?

1522
01:21:20,752 --> 01:21:24,464
There's a man whose name
was mentioned to me a couple of times.

1523
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,548
Eltenton.

1524
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:29,802
Uh, I believe he's a chemist
who works at Shell.

1525
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,014
He talked to a friend of his

1526
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,933
who's an acquaintance
of someone on the project.

1527
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,063
And you thought Pash
would be satisfied with that?

1528
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:43,983
I was attempting to give them Eltenton
without opening a can of worms.

1529
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,943
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

1530
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,528
Did you lie to General Groves too?

1531
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:51,115
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1532
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,909
[attorney]
Do you recall this conversation

1533
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,452
about the Chevalier incident?

1534
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:57,497
[scoffs] I've seen so many versions of it,

1535
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,083
I wasn't confused before
but I'm certainly getting there now.

1536
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,375
[attorney]
What was your conclusion?

1537
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:06,756
That he was under the influence of
the typical American schoolboy attitude

1538
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,301
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1539
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,552
Well, now...

1540
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:14,889
Might we know through whom
the contact was made?

1541
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:19,268
That would involve people
who are not to be involved in this.

1542
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:22,188
Is that someone
a member of the project?

1543
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:26,234
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1544
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:27,318
Ah.

1545
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:32,490
So Eltenton made his approach through
a member of the faculty here at Berkeley?

1546
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,869
As far as I know— As far as I know, yes.

1547
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,871
But... [stammers]... there may have been...

1548
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,457
more than one person involved.

1549
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:50,424
Gentlemen, if I— if I seem uncooperative,
I think you can understand

1550
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:51,634
it's because of my insistence

1551
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,595
in not getting innocent people
into trouble.

1552
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,515
You're trying to protect your friend.
Who's protecting you?

1553
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,184
- Well, you could.
- If you gave me the name.

1554
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:01,853
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1555
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,022
That is a mistake, Robert.
You need to volunteer this name.

1556
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,901
- [Robb] <i>And did he give you the name?</i>
- [Groves] <i>He did.</i>

1557
01:23:08,985 --> 01:23:10,278
- [Robb] But not then, did he?
- No.

1558
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,864
No. In fact,
it was some months later, wasn't it?

1559
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:13,948
It was.

1560
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,826
- You see me as persistent.
- Well, you are-

1561
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,870
You are persistent, but that is your job.

1562
01:23:18,953 --> 01:23:22,498
And—And my job is to protect the people
that work for me.

1563
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:26,335
Instead of us going on certain steps,
which may come to your attention...

1564
01:23:28,004 --> 01:23:29,922
and be disturbing to you,

1565
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:32,258
I would like to discuss those
with you first.

1566
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:36,679
I'm not formulating a plan.
I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1567
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:44,103
In the months in between your interview
with Dr. Oppenheimer

1568
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:46,772
and his eventual naming of Chevalier,

1569
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:49,775
did you expend resources trying to find
the name of the intermediary?

1570
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:52,236
Considerable resources, yes.

1571
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,363
Without the name,
our job was extremely difficult.

1572
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:55,823
And when did you receive the name?

1573
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:58,784
I was gone by the time Oppenheimer
finally offered it up.

1574
01:23:58,868 --> 01:23:59,744
Gone?

1575
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,954
They felt my time
would be better spent in Europe

1576
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:04,373
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1577
01:24:04,457 --> 01:24:05,625
Who did?

1578
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:07,919
General Groves.

1579
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,338
He transferred me to London.

[Serber]
<i>It's a little early for a Christmas party.</i>

1582
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:22,266
Something's up.
Tolman's been away.

1583
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,352
Where?

1584
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,020
Ruth won't tell.

1585
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,900
[chattering]

1586
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:31,984
Hey!

1587
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,367
Come on, Ruthie.
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1588
01:24:39,951 --> 01:24:41,410
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1589
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:44,664
What makes you think
I know where he is anyway?

1590
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,499
'Cause you do a pretty good job of knowing

1591
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,417
where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

1592
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,086
Like now?

1593
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:53,506
[Groves] Attention!

1594
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,049
[chattering stops]

1595
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,386
[Groves]
Early Christmas present for you all.

1596
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:01,097
[scattered laughter]

1597
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,101
[cheering]

1598
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:09,146
[Bohr] <i>The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1599
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,233
Showed me the—the oxygen,
you know, but I messed it up.

1600
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,317
[scattered laughter]

1601
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:15,695
When they opened me up in Scotland,
I was unconscious.

1602
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:18,739
- But I pretended I'd been napping.
- [laughing]

1603
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,241
[Bohr] Please enjoy your party.

1604
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,785
Is it big enough?

1605
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,245
To end the war?

1606
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:27,039
To end all war.

1607
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:33,963
- Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.
- [marbles clattering]

1608
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:37,967
It was chilling,
my old student working for the Nazis.

1609
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,762
He told me some things to draw me out.

1610
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:45,683
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1611
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:47,852
That sounds more like a reactor
than a bomb.

1612
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,687
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

1613
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,981
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1614
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,816
As a moderator?

1615
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,151
Yes, instead of graphite.

1616
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,111
[Bethe laughs]

1617
01:25:58,237 --> 01:25:59,530
What?

1618
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,367
He took a wrong turn. We're ahead.

1619
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,369
And with you here to help us, Niels...

1620
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:09,123
Sorry, could you— could you
give us a moment, gentlemen?

1621
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,291
[glasses clinking]

1622
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,923
I am not here to help, Robert.

1623
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:20,634
I knew you could do this without me.

1624
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:22,845
- Then why did you come?
- To talk about after.

1625
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:27,350
The power you're about to reveal
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1626
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,685
And the world is not prepared.

1627
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:33,314
"You could lift the stone without being
ready for the snake that's revealed."

1628
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,232
We have to make
the politicians understand,

1629
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,859
this isn't a new weapon.

1630
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:38,611
It's a new world.

1631
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:41,781
I'll be out there doing what I can,
but you...

1632
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:45,159
You are an American Prometheus.

1633
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:49,121
The man who gave them the power
to destroy themselves,

1634
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:50,956
and they'll respect that.

1635
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,042
Then your work really begins.

1636
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,049
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1637
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:03,177
From San Francisco.

1638
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:11,352
Robert?

1639
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:16,982
Robert?

1640
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:20,111
Robert. Robert.

1641
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:21,695
Oh, my God. What's the matter?

1642
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:22,947
What happened?

1643
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:24,407
[both breathing heavily]

1644
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:26,367
Her father called.

1645
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,077
They found her yesterday in the bath.

1646
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:30,996
Who?

1647
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,041
She'd taken pills.

1648
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,459
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1649
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,880
She took barbiturates, but there
was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1650
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,465
[gasping]

1651
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,677
There was a note.

1652
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:46,887
Jean Tatlock?

1653
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,854
We were together.

1654
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:57,314
She said she needed me. I...

1655
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:01,819
I told her I... [breathing shakily]... I wouldn't—

1656
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:04,405
I told her I couldn't—

1657
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:06,490
No, it was— it was me—

1658
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:11,328
[breathing heavily]
You don't get to commit the sin

1659
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:14,790
and then have us all feel sorry for you
that it had consequences.

1660
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:20,004
You pull yourself together.

1661
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:25,926
You know, people here depend on you.

1662
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,264
[Serber] Donald, would you like
to contribute here, please?

1663
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,515
[Donald] You're on your own, pal.

1664
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:34,518
Bob, I'm not quitting my job
because plutonium is radioactive.

1665
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:37,521
We just don't know what it might do
to the female reproductive system—

1666
01:28:37,605 --> 01:28:40,691
Your reproductive system is
more exposed than mine, presumably.

1667
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:43,444
Can we please?
The implosion device is nowhere.

1668
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,070
You can't rush everything.
Oppie, please.

1669
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:47,781
Well, there's rushing and there's
getting on with it, so, pick one.

1670
01:28:47,865 --> 01:28:49,742
Wait. Neddermeyer's doing his job.

1671
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,453
Teller's not helping. You're not helping.

1672
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:55,080
I've been asking for calculations
on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1673
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:57,791
- The British can do it. Fuchs.
- Absolutely.

1674
01:28:57,875 --> 01:29:01,170
- It's your job, Teller.
- I'm engaged in research.

1675
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:03,672
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1676
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:05,382
[scattered laughter]

1677
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:13,140
I won't work for that man.

1678
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,017
[jeering]

1679
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,269
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1680
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,313
[Serber] I agree.
He should leave Los Alamos.

1681
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,898
Okay.

1682
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:24,193
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1683
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:27,780
Lilli, you go work for Kisty,
because he needs you.

1684
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,532
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1685
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:32,409
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1686
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:36,121
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1687
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,708
[vehicle engine starting]

1688
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,794
[chattering on loudspeaker]

1689
01:29:50,511 --> 01:29:51,762
They won't let me leave.

1690
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,806
No. I won't let you leave.

1691
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:58,102
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1692
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:01,313
Stay here, research what you want.

1693
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,732
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1694
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,109
We'll meet to discuss.

1695
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:08,028
You don't have time to meet.
You're a politician now, Robert.

1696
01:30:08,112 --> 01:30:10,656
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1697
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:12,825
Once a week.

1698
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,244
One hour, you and me.

1699
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,835
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1700
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,510
[Robb] <i>So the Super was under development
on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1701
01:30:31,594 --> 01:30:33,012
Yes.

1702
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:36,557
And yet, after the war,
you tried to deny it was viable.

1703
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,727
No, no, no. I pointed out
technical difficulties with it.

1704
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,770
Didn't you try to kill it
at the AEC meeting

1705
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,272
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

1706
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,609
[Robb] But that was the recommendation
of the AEC, was it not?

1707
01:30:46,692 --> 01:30:49,820
After hours of discussion
about the best response.

1708
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:55,117
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power
of an A-bomb.

1709
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:59,997
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

1710
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,624
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

1711
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:05,919
Izzy, draw some circles on this side
of the map where they would target us.

1712
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:07,129
Starting with New York.

1713
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,339
- [Rabi] That's fair.
- [Strauss] DC.

1714
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:11,050
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

1715
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:12,635
- Deterrence.
- [Bush] "Deterrence"?

1716
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:16,805
Do we really need more deterrence
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1717
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:20,934
Y-You drown in ten feet of water
or 10,000, what's the difference?

1718
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,145
We can already drown Russia. They know it.

1719
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,522
- Now they can drown us.
- [Rabi] We're just escalating.

1720
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:32,363
- [feet stamping]
- [Strauss, distant] Robert? Robert.

1721
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:34,531
- [stamping stops]
- [teaspoon clinks]

1722
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:37,368
As I said,

1723
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:41,288
Teller's designs are still as impractical
as they were during the war.

1724
01:31:41,372 --> 01:31:44,208
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work,
Oppie, you know that.

1725
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,086
I don't believe we should commit
all our resources to that chance.

1726
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:50,172
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

1727
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:52,591
Simply by limiting the spread
of atomic weapons

1728
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:55,135
through international control
on nuclear energy.

1729
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:57,471
By which you mean world government.

1730
01:31:57,554 --> 01:32:00,391
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.

1731
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:03,352
Well, I asked
what Truman should do, right?

1732
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:04,436
The world's changed.

1733
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,898
It's not fascism but communism
that now threatens our survival.

1734
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:09,858
Lewis, do you understand,

1735
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,527
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1736
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,821
the Russians will have no choice
but to build their own?

1737
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:15,447
Could they be working on one already,

1738
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:18,534
based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos?

1739
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:20,077
No spy at Los Alamos.

1740
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,996
- Gentlemen. Let's not get sidetracked.
- There wasn't?

1741
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,749
I say we use this moment
to gain concessions from the Russians

1742
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:28,794
by committing that we will not build
a hydrogen bomb.

1743
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:30,546
Thereby revealing its existence.

1744
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:32,631
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

1745
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:36,135
[clears throat] All right. At this point,
I'd like the committee members

1746
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:39,888
to meet in privacy
to finalize our recommendations.

1747
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:43,392
I'm just not sure
you wanna go down this road.

1748
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,476
Lewis, with respect,

1749
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,354
we are the advisory committee,
we will give them our advice.

1750
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,111
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1751
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,320
Hi.

1752
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:58,240
William Borden.
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy?

1753
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,575
Oh, yes, yes.

1754
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,034
During the war, I was a pilot.

1755
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:05,122
One night, flying back from a raid,

1756
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:06,999
I saw an amazing sight,

1757
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,751
<i>like a meteor.</i>

1758
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:11,962
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

1759
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,048
I can't help but imagine what it will be
for such an enemy rocket

1760
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:17,968
to carry an atomic warhead.

1761
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:19,762
[feet stamping]

1762
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:21,764
[rocket rumbling]

1763
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:25,142
[stamping intensifies, stops]

1764
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,563
Well, let's make sure we're not the ones
to make that possible.

1765
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:38,030
Oppie, I don't think
you wanna go up against Strauss.

1766
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:41,033
If we both speak, they listen to me.

1767
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,452
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

1768
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,370
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

1769
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:47,539
They'll listen to a prophet.

1770
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:49,541
A prophet can't be wrong.

1771
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:50,542
Not once.

1772
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:54,129
[McGee] <i>Didn't you accuse Oppenheimer of
sabotaging the development of the Super?</i>

1773
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:58,509
I was never one of those to bandy around
terms like "sabotage."

1774
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,010
[McGee] But Mr. Borden was?

1775
01:34:00,636 --> 01:34:02,346
As I understand it, possibly.

1776
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:06,099
How was Mr. Borden able to put together
such a detailed indictment?

1777
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:07,768
He was no longer a government employee,

1778
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,020
yet he appears to have had
unlimited access

1779
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,605
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1780
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,441
<i>Might Mr. Nichols
have given him access to the file?</i>

1781
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:16,652
Or someone else at the AEC?

1782
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:19,446
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

1783
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:21,114
Is it your intention to suggest

1784
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:23,867
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is disloyal to the United States?

1785
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,537
I've always assumed, and still assume,

1786
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:29,039
that he's loyal to the United States.

1787
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:30,165
I believe this.

1788
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:33,627
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1789
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:37,714
[Robb] <i>Do you, or do you not, believe
that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?</i>

1790
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:49,685
[Hornig] And if I may, when Hitler
blew his brains out in that bunker,

1791
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:53,021
it is my humble opinion that
there is no need for that bomb to be seen

1792
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:54,606
anywhere except for that test site.

1793
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,566
[scattered applause]

1794
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:58,235
[Lilli] We at least
have to take a moment to think about

1795
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:01,405
whether the means
justify the ends any longer, because—

1796
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:06,285
Germany is about to surrender.

1797
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,328
[members cheering, applauding]

1798
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:12,416
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat to mankind.

1799
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:13,417
It's our work.

1800
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:18,505
Hitler is dead, it's true.

1801
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:22,009
But the Japanese fight on.

1802
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,844
Their defeat seems assured.

1803
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,555
Not if you're a GI preparing to invade.

1804
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:29,182
We can end this war.

1805
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:32,603
But how do we justify using this weapon
on human beings?

1806
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:33,896
[scattered applause]

1807
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:38,734
We're theorists, yes?

1808
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:44,197
We imagine a future,
and our imaginings horrify us.

1809
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:47,910
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

1810
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:50,662
and they won't understand it
until they've used it.

1811
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:54,583
When the world learns the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

1812
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:58,086
our work here will ensure a peace
mankind has never seen.

1813
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:01,298
A peace based
on the kind of international cooperation

1814
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:03,508
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1815
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:11,558
- [Oppenheimer] Progress?
- Two years and a billion dollars' worth?

1816
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:14,144
Well, hard to put a price on it.

1817
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,896
Not really. Just add up the bills.

1818
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:20,233
"Rural free deliveries."
Eighty babies delivered the first year.

1819
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:22,903
This year we've had ten a month.

1820
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,864
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

1821
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:27,449
- Clearly.
- [Kitty] General.

1822
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,617
Kiddo.

1823
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:36,667
Head down, every— Fuchs. Head down.

1824
01:36:43,674 --> 01:36:45,550
That's the one. [grunts]

1825
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:48,136
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

1826
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,391
September.

1827
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:53,517
July.

1828
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,394
That's the sweet spot, gentlemen.

1829
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:57,729
August.

1830
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,356
July.

1831
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,484
Test in July. But I need my brother.

1832
01:37:06,822 --> 01:37:09,408
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

1833
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,702
he's been working with Lawrence
for two years now.

1834
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,377
What do we call the test?

1835
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,340
"Batter my heart,
three person'd God."

1836
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:26,425
What?

1837
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,011
Trinity.

1838
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,187
[Robb] You insisted on bringing
on your brother Frank,

1839
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:40,397
a known communist.

1840
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,107
Former communist.

1841
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,109
You brought a known former communist

1842
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:47,946
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

1843
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:51,283
I knew my brother could be trusted.
Absolutely.

1844
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:54,619
And you felt your judgment was sound
on who on the team could be trusted.

1845
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:58,415
Fuchs, head down.
Okay, everybody ready.

1846
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:09,384
I hope you learned something.

1847
01:38:09,468 --> 01:38:11,845
Yeah, we learned
we're gonna need to be a lot further away.

1848
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:13,305
Well, figure it out. Fast.

1849
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:16,391
We leave for Washington in the morning.
We're gonna give them a date.

1850
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,229
[elevator bell dings]

1851
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:22,522
[chattering]

1852
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:24,566
[phone ringing]

1853
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,650
[service bell dinging]

1854
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:33,325
You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

1855
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:36,328
If we don't act now, they're going
to use this thing against Japan.

1856
01:38:36,912 --> 01:38:39,831
We booked a meeting with Truman,
but somebody killed it.

1857
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:42,250
You're meeting the secretary of war.

1858
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:43,877
Just because we're building it

1859
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,754
doesn't mean
we get to decide how it's used.

1860
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:48,715
History will judge us, Robert.

1861
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,551
In Chicago,
we put together a petition.

1862
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:53,887
I'm not getting into that.

1863
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,555
[clipboard clatters]

1864
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:01,019
Just tell me your concerns
and I'll relay them.

1865
01:39:01,103 --> 01:39:02,145
My concerns?

1866
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:05,607
Germany's defeated.
Japan's not going to hold out alone.

1867
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,901
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

1868
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:11,404
You and Einstein with your letter
to Roosevelt saying we could build a bomb.

1869
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,405
Against Germany.

1870
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:15,367
That's not how weapons manufacture
works, Szilard.

1871
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,701
[Szilard] Oppie, you have to help.

1872
01:39:16,785 --> 01:39:18,537
Fermi's in the meeting.
Lawrence is in the meeting.

1873
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:21,832
They're not you.
You're the great salesman of science.

1874
01:39:21,915 --> 01:39:24,126
You can convince anyone of anything.

1875
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:26,086
Even yourself.

1876
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,921
Excuse me.

1877
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:32,634
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

1878
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,177
Mostly civilians.

1879
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,849
I worry about an America where we
do these things and no one protests.

1880
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:42,269
Pearl Harbor and three years
of brutal conflict in the Pacific

1881
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:44,604
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

1882
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,149
[Stimson]
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

1883
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:50,485
[Fermi] The A-bomb might not cause
as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1884
01:39:50,569 --> 01:39:52,028
What are we estimating?

1885
01:39:52,112 --> 01:39:56,908
In a medium-sized city,
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1886
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:59,035
Yes, but don't underestimate

1887
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:02,539
the psychological impact
of an atomic explosion.

1888
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:06,418
A pillar of fire 10,000 feet tall.

1889
01:40:07,127 --> 01:40:10,213
Deadly neutron effects for a mile.
In all directions.

1890
01:40:10,297 --> 01:40:13,175
From one single device.

1891
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:15,427
Dropped from a barely noticed B-29,

1892
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:20,682
the atomic bomb will be
a terrible revelation of divine power.

1893
01:40:21,308 --> 01:40:23,935
If that's true, it would be definitive.

1894
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:26,021
World War II would be over.

1895
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:27,647
Our boys would come home.

1896
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:28,857
Military targets?

1897
01:40:30,192 --> 01:40:32,194
Uh... There aren't any big enough.

1898
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:35,197
Perhaps a vital war plant

1899
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,866
with workers housed nearby?

1900
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:41,119
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

1901
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:43,121
They'd send everything they have
up against us,

1902
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:44,873
and I'd be up in that plane.

1903
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:48,168
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

1904
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,837
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

1905
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:55,342
Is there no way to demonstrate
a bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?

1906
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:59,554
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms. Twice.

1907
01:40:59,638 --> 01:41:01,848
Once, to show the weapon's power,

1908
01:41:01,932 --> 01:41:05,352
and a second to show that we can
keep doing this until they surrender.

1909
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:08,813
We have a list of 12 cities
to choose from—

1910
01:41:08,897 --> 01:41:10,815
Sorry, 11.

1911
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:12,776
I've taken Kyoto off the list

1912
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:16,404
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

1913
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:18,698
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

1914
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,492
It's a magnificent city.

1915
01:41:24,162 --> 01:41:25,956
Let me make this simple for you,
gentlemen.

1916
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:28,500
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

1917
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,671
the Japanese people will not surrender,
under any circumstances,

1918
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:36,049
short of a successful
and total invasion of the home islands.

1919
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,386
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

1920
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:43,390
The use of the atomic bomb
on Japanese cities will save lives.

1921
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:45,392
If we retain moral advantage.

1922
01:41:46,059 --> 01:41:47,227
How so?

1923
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:49,479
Well, if we use this weapon
without informing our allies,

1924
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:52,440
they'll see it as a threat,
and we'll be in an arms race.

1925
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:54,442
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

1926
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:58,571
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets
from becoming part of the atomic world.

1927
01:41:58,655 --> 01:42:00,657
We've been told
they have no uranium.

1928
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,702
You've been misinformed.
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1929
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:07,247
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

1930
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,874
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

1931
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:13,920
not all scientists
on the project are in agreement.

1932
01:42:14,004 --> 01:42:17,590
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions. If you talk—

1933
01:42:17,674 --> 01:42:20,343
The Manhattan Project
has been plagued from the start

1934
01:42:20,427 --> 01:42:23,805
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

1935
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,307
and uncertain loyalty.

1936
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,392
One of them just tried to meet
with the president.

1937
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:30,562
Now, we need these men,
but as soon as it's practical,

1938
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:32,939
we should sever any such scientists
from the program.

1939
01:42:33,023 --> 01:42:34,274
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1940
01:42:35,859 --> 01:42:37,527
[Marshall]
if a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1941
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:41,281
perhaps we should invite
their top scientists to Trinity?

1942
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:44,951
President Truman has no intention
of raising expectations

1943
01:42:45,035 --> 01:42:47,704
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

1944
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,247
Informing him of our breakthrough

1945
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:51,249
and presenting it
as a means to win the war

1946
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,126
need not make unkeepable promises.

1947
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:55,337
But the Potsdam peace conference in July

1948
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,757
will be President Truman's last chance
to have that conversation.

1949
01:42:59,466 --> 01:43:01,301
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

1950
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,889
Absolutely. We will test fire
before the conference.

1951
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:16,983
Ground Zero, observation posts
at 10,000 yards north, south and west.

1952
01:43:17,067 --> 01:43:18,068
Where do we trigger from?

1953
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:20,236
South, 10,000.

1954
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,573
And Base Camp is ten miles south here.

1955
01:43:23,656 --> 01:43:28,912
And there's a further observation post
on— on that hill 20 miles away.

1956
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:31,915
What's that, Frank?
Trigger lines already went in.

1957
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:35,460
The Air Force requested
a line of lights for their B-29.

1958
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:37,879
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

1959
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,049
They wanna use the test
to confirm a safe operating distance.

1960
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:43,843
- That's risky.
- Not as risky as dropping one over Japan

1961
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:45,887
and hoping that we were right
about the blast radius.

1962
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:48,139
Don't let them slow us down.
We're firing on the 15th.

1963
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:50,517
- The 15th? That's not-
- [Groves] The 15th.

1964
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:53,228
The 15th.

1965
01:43:54,604 --> 01:43:56,564
[Oppenheimer] So I'll be here
at South Observation point

1966
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:58,942
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1967
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:02,779
You'll all be assigned
to Base Camp, West Observation,

1968
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:04,447
or Far Observation.

1969
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:18,294
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful with the knife. There, carefully.

1970
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:23,842
- Are those safe distances?
- They're based on your calculations.

1971
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:26,469
Time to stand behind your science, Hans.
Literally.

1972
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:51,119
Yeah.

1973
01:44:56,416 --> 01:44:58,084
What about the radiation cloud?

1974
01:44:58,168 --> 01:45:01,296
Without high winds, it should settle
within two to three miles.

1975
01:45:01,379 --> 01:45:03,590
Evacuation measures are in place.
[inhales]

1976
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:06,468
But we need good weather for visibility,
so it has to be fine.

1977
01:45:07,927 --> 01:45:09,262
Everybody out.

1978
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:21,399
We go on the night of the 15th.

1979
01:45:21,483 --> 01:45:25,445
It's a hard deadline,
so if anyone has anything, speak now.

1980
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:27,697
Little, little more. Okay, stop, stop.

1981
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:31,576
Everybody, mattresses.
Put the mattress underneath.

1982
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:51,346
Could use a final implosion test.

1983
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,683
- It couldn't hurt.
- Do it.

1984
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:59,145
Is there anything else that might stop us?

1985
01:45:59,229 --> 01:46:00,438
[thunderclap]

1986
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:05,109
[sheets flapping]

1987
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:35,557
It's happening, isn't it?

1988
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,143
I'll send a message.

1989
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:41,312
If it's gone our way...

1990
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:43,982
take in the sheets.

1991
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:49,195
Robert.

1992
01:46:52,407 --> 01:46:53,449
Break a leg.

1993
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:07,797
Okay.

1994
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:03,102
[Fermi] Oppie's taken
a very modest three kilotons.

1995
01:48:03,186 --> 01:48:05,438
- Teller's in with 45.
- [Rabi] Twenty.

1996
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:07,774
20,000 tons of TNT.

1997
01:48:07,857 --> 01:48:11,152
And does anyone want the side action
on atmospheric ignition?

1998
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:13,112
[laughter]

1999
01:48:13,905 --> 01:48:17,075
- Are you saying we'll have to delay?
- I'm saying it would be prudent.

2000
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:18,951
This weather,
has it reached the site?

2001
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:23,998
[phone ringing]

2002
01:48:24,082 --> 01:48:26,250
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2003
01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:28,878
Hello, Hans. Yes, he's here.

2004
01:48:30,171 --> 01:48:31,172
Yes.

2005
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:33,591
[handset settles in cradle]

2006
01:48:33,675 --> 01:48:35,301
- Is he wrong?
- No.

2007
01:48:35,385 --> 01:48:37,136
- No?
- No.

2008
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,598
- So we're about to fire a dud?
- No.

2009
01:48:40,682 --> 01:48:44,060
- Explain.
- Well, I can't. I just-I just know.

2010
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:45,853
I know the implosion lenses will work.

2011
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:48,356
If we fire these detonators
and they don't trigger a reaction,

2012
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:52,068
two years' worth of plutonium
will be scattered across White Sands.

2013
01:48:52,151 --> 01:48:54,779
A month of my salary
against ten bucks says it lights.

2014
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:56,406
Jesus.

2015
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:05,832
[weatherman] The wind's picking up
at Zero, not the rain.

2016
01:49:05,915 --> 01:49:06,999
Lightning circling.

2017
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,876
You think it might be time
to tell your men

2018
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,629
to get away from the steel tower
with the atomic bomb?

2019
01:49:11,713 --> 01:49:14,841
[laughter]

2020
01:49:14,924 --> 01:49:17,552
- Let's get to South Observation.
- Pull 'em out.

2021
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:19,721
[Oppenheimer]
We can make our determination there.

2022
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:22,849
[thunderclap]

2023
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:27,019
[Oppenheimer]
The team hasn't slept in two nights.

2024
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:30,440
If we stand down, make the bomb safe,
we won't be back here for weeks.

2025
01:49:30,523 --> 01:49:34,235
Then we'll miss Potsdam.
I gotta get word to Truman by 7:00.

2026
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:36,279
Our window's closing.
What is this doing?

2027
01:49:36,362 --> 01:49:37,739
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2028
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:39,991
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

2029
01:49:40,074 --> 01:49:42,243
- It'll break before dawn.
- How could you know that?

2030
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:44,328
I know this desert.
Storm cools overnight.

2031
01:49:44,412 --> 01:49:46,456
Just before dawn, the storm breaks.

2032
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:48,708
He could be right,
but schedule as late as possible.

2033
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:50,042
5:30.

2034
01:49:50,126 --> 01:49:52,462
Sign your forecast.
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2035
01:49:52,545 --> 01:49:54,756
- Frank, tell them all, 5:30.
- 5:30.

2036
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,007
- 5:30.
- 5:30.

2037
01:49:58,676 --> 01:50:00,386
Three years,

Well, we had a moment

2047

where it looked like the chain reaction
from an atomic device might never stop.

that when we push that button,

we destroy the world?

Nothing in our research over three years
supports that conclusion.

Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

I don't think I could give a precise—

Never.

Never.

2286
02:10:34,494 --> 02:10:37,789
Mr. President,
the Russians have good physicists

- a-a-and abundant resources.
- Abundant?

- [Truman chuckles]
- Yes.

- I don't think so.
- [chuckles]

2290
02:10:44,379 --> 02:10:47,924
Well, they'll put everything they have in...

2291
02:10:51,761 --> 02:10:56,516
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.
[sniffles]

2292
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:57,851
What should we do with it?

2293
02:10:57,934 --> 02:11:00,061
Give it back to the Indians.

2294
02:11:07,736 --> 02:11:10,989
Um, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2295
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:14,200
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

2296
02:11:14,284 --> 02:11:18,371
we have to build up Los Alamos,
not shut it down.

2297
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:23,668
Mr. President...

2298
02:11:24,878 --> 02:11:26,004
Um...

2299
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:32,802
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

2300
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:57,786
You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2301
02:11:57,869 --> 02:12:00,789
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2302
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,503
They care who dropped it.

2303
02:12:07,295 --> 02:12:08,296
I did.

2304
02:12:11,216 --> 02:12:13,676
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2305
02:12:20,141 --> 02:12:21,434

<i>By the time I met him,</i>

2310
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:49,838
<i>he'd fully embraced
his "father of the bomb" reputation.</i>

2311
02:12:49,921 --> 02:12:52,257
And he used his profile

[Robb]
<i>Doctor, in the years following the war,</i>

2315
02:13:03,268 --> 02:13:05,353
would you say
that you exerted a great influence

2316
02:13:05,436 --> 02:13:07,313
on the atomic policies of the USA?

2317
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:09,941
[Oppenheimer]
<i>I think "great" would be an overstatement.</i>

2318
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:11,860
[Robb] Really?
If we look at the issue of isotopes,

2319
02:13:11,943 --> 02:13:15,572
were you not personally responsible for
destroying all opposition to their export?

2320
02:13:15,655 --> 02:13:18,074
- You could use a bottle of beer...

2321
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:19,325
... when making atomic weapons.

2322
02:13:19,409 --> 02:13:20,410
In fact, you do.

2323
02:13:20,493 --> 02:13:21,870
I was the spokesman,

2324
02:13:21,953 --> 02:13:24,455
but the opinion among scientists
was unanimous.

2325
02:13:24,539 --> 02:13:27,625
All along with McCarthy on the rise,
he knew he was vulnerable.

2326
02:13:28,501 --> 02:13:32,172
His brother was blacklisted
by every university in the country.

2327
02:13:33,673 --> 02:13:36,801
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2328
02:13:38,511 --> 02:13:40,763
And Chevalier went into exile.

2329
02:13:42,599 --> 02:13:46,477
But none of that stopped Robert
from pushing the GAC

2330
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:48,980
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2331
02:13:51,316 --> 02:13:54,569
He was devastated when Truman
rejected their recommendation.

2332
02:13:56,696 --> 02:13:58,364
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

2333
02:13:58,448 --> 02:14:00,450
I know, Ruth, I know.

2334
02:14:00,533 --> 02:14:03,620
Part of me's glad he didn't live to see
where this is all going.

2335
02:14:06,873 --> 02:14:08,791
Here comes the birthday boy.

2336
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:10,001
To gloat.

2337
02:14:10,084 --> 02:14:11,794
Have fun.

2338
02:14:11,878 --> 02:14:13,838
Robert, uh, my son and his fiancée

2339
02:14:13,922 --> 02:14:16,257
are desperate to meet
the father of the atomic bomb, and so...

2340
02:14:16,341 --> 02:14:18,426
Well... good day.

2341
02:14:25,475 --> 02:14:26,768
Is this a bad time?

2342
02:14:27,435 --> 02:14:28,645
What do you think, Lewis?

2343
02:14:29,229 --> 02:14:31,356
Well, I think it must have been
a blow for you.

2344
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:32,482
For the world.

2345
02:14:34,108 --> 02:14:37,111
The world? What does Fuchs mean
to the rest of the world?

2346
02:14:38,655 --> 02:14:40,073
Fuchs?

2347
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:41,532
Klaus Fuchs?

2348
02:14:43,201 --> 02:14:45,411
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2349
02:14:48,623 --> 02:14:50,667
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

2350
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:53,294
that you put onto the implosion team
at Los Alamos...

2351
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:59,175
turns out he was spying for the Soviets
the whole time.

2352
02:14:59,259 --> 02:15:00,468
I'm sorry.

2353
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:08,935
[Strauss]
<i>After the truth about Fuchs came out,</i>

2354
02:15:09,018 --> 02:15:11,020
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2355
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:13,690
He knew his phone was tapped,

2356
02:15:13,773 --> 02:15:15,566
he was followed everywhere,

2357
02:15:16,359 --> 02:15:17,986
his trash picked through.

2358
02:15:21,197 --> 02:15:25,410
- But never stopped speaking his mind.
- A man of conviction.

2359
02:15:25,493 --> 02:15:28,413
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2360
02:15:30,665 --> 02:15:33,543
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2361
02:15:35,086 --> 02:15:36,087
He took it.

2362
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:42,885
America and Russia may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle,

2363
02:15:42,969 --> 02:15:49,225
each capable of killing the other,
but only at the risk of his own life.

2364
02:15:49,809 --> 02:15:51,936
Now, there are various aspects
of this policy—

2365
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:57,025
[Strauss] <i>Lot of scientists blame me,
but how was I supposed to protect him?</i>

2366
02:15:57,108 --> 02:16:00,528
... are too secret for discussion,
candor is the only remedy.

2367
02:16:00,611 --> 02:16:04,198
Officials in Washington need to start
leveling with the American people.

2368
02:16:04,282 --> 02:16:05,992
[murmuring]

2369
02:16:06,075 --> 02:16:08,745
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2370
02:16:08,828 --> 02:16:10,830
So he had to lose his security clearance?

2371
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:13,499
- And with it, his credibility.
- [knocks on window]

2372
02:16:13,583 --> 02:16:15,835
But how could they do it?

2373
02:16:15,918 --> 02:16:19,005
He was a war hero.
He'd already told everyone about his past.

2374
02:16:19,088 --> 02:16:21,299
Borden dredged it all up.

2375
02:16:21,382 --> 02:16:24,552
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2376
02:16:24,635 --> 02:16:28,431
- Could it have been Nichols?
- No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2377
02:16:28,514 --> 02:16:30,516
But whoever did unleashed a firestorm

2378
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,979
that burned a path from the White House
back to my desk at the AEC.

2379
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:37,106
You see him in there, right?

2380
02:16:37,857 --> 02:16:40,151
I've worked my whole life to get here,

2381
02:16:40,943 --> 02:16:43,154
Cabinet of the United States of America,

2382
02:16:43,237 --> 02:16:46,783
and now, in front of the entire country,
they're gonna put me back in my place.

2383
02:16:48,618 --> 02:16:50,286
A lowly shoe salesman.

2384
02:16:50,995 --> 02:16:53,122
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2385
02:16:53,206 --> 02:16:56,292
I-I think we can get the Senate
to grasp that you did your duty,

2386
02:16:56,376 --> 02:16:58,002
painful though it was.

2387
02:16:58,086 --> 02:17:00,546
- Now, will Hill's testimony back us up?
- Hill will be fine.

2388
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,631
I don't really know him,

2389
02:17:01,714 --> 02:17:04,008
but he was one of Szilard's boys
in Chicago,

2390
02:17:04,092 --> 02:17:05,593
and they never forgave Robert

2391
02:17:05,676 --> 02:17:07,970
for not supporting the petition
against bombing Japan.

2392
02:17:08,054 --> 02:17:09,138
[projector clicks]

2393
02:17:09,222 --> 02:17:12,683
[Morrison] This was taken
31 days after the bombing.

2394
02:17:13,601 --> 02:17:17,897
Virtually everyone in the street
for nearly a mile around,

2395
02:17:18,606 --> 02:17:21,776
was instantly and seriously burned.

2396
02:17:21,859 --> 02:17:22,944
[audience gasping]

2397
02:17:23,027 --> 02:17:27,782
[Morrison] The Japanese spoke of people
who wore striped clothing

2398
02:17:27,865 --> 02:17:30,493
upon whom, the skin was burned in stripes.

2399
02:17:31,661 --> 02:17:34,205
There were many
who thought themselves lucky,

2400
02:17:34,288 --> 02:17:38,167
who climbed out of the ruins
of their homes, only slightly injured.

2401
02:17:39,919 --> 02:17:41,462
But they died anyway.

2402
02:17:42,422 --> 02:17:46,759
They died days or weeks later
from the radium-like rays

2403
02:17:46,843 --> 02:17:50,721
emitted in great numbers
at the moment of the explosion.

2404
02:17:52,056 --> 02:17:54,142
Did you read
this crap in the papers?

2405
02:17:54,225 --> 02:17:56,227
A British physicist is saying

2406
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:59,230
the atomic bombings
were not the last act of World War II,

2407
02:17:59,313 --> 02:18:02,191
but the first act of this cold war
with Russia.

2408
02:18:02,275 --> 02:18:03,693
Which physicist?

2409
02:18:03,776 --> 02:18:06,446
I think you knew him.
Patrick Blackett.

2410
02:18:07,947 --> 02:18:09,240
[scoffs]

2411
02:18:09,323 --> 02:18:10,825
He may not be wrong.

2412
02:18:10,908 --> 02:18:12,368
Stimson is now telling me

2413
02:18:12,452 --> 02:18:15,621
we bombed an enemy
that was essentially defeated.

2414
02:18:15,705 --> 02:18:18,207
Robert, you've all the influence now.

2415
02:18:19,041 --> 02:18:20,585
Please.

2416
02:18:20,668 --> 02:18:22,962
Urge them to continue my research
on the Super.

2417
02:18:23,045 --> 02:18:25,173
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2418
02:18:25,256 --> 02:18:26,591
Why not?

2419
02:18:26,674 --> 02:18:28,134
It's not the right use of our resources.

2420
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:30,303
Is that what you really believe?

2421
02:18:31,095 --> 02:18:35,057
J. Robert Oppenheimer.
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2422
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:38,019
Nobody knows what you believe.

2423
02:18:39,228 --> 02:18:41,022
Do you? Hmm?

2424
02:18:41,522 --> 02:18:43,983
[Groves] <i>One final time,
our program director,</i>

2425
02:18:44,066 --> 02:18:45,735
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2426
02:18:47,403 --> 02:18:49,614
[Oppenheimer]
I hope that, in years to come,

2427
02:18:49,697 --> 02:18:52,241
you will look back on your work
here with pride.

2428
02:18:53,034 --> 02:18:57,330
But today that pride must be tempered
with a profound concern.

2429
02:18:59,165 --> 02:19:02,793
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenals of a warring world,

2430
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:08,508
then the day will come when people
will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2431
02:19:12,762 --> 02:19:15,348
Sorry, Admiral. Stopped off to get this.

2432
02:19:16,516 --> 02:19:18,476
It seems pretty favorable.

2433
02:19:19,268 --> 02:19:21,729
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

2434
02:19:21,812 --> 02:19:24,607
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought...

2435
02:19:26,442 --> 02:19:27,693
and the US won."

2436
02:19:28,861 --> 02:19:29,862
That'll work.

2437
02:19:29,946 --> 02:19:32,365
Those were your words from the other day.

2438
02:19:32,448 --> 02:19:33,699
We needed to pivot.

2439
02:19:34,325 --> 02:19:36,911
But how would you know what
<i>Time</i> magazine's gonna write?

2440
02:19:36,994 --> 02:19:38,579
Henry Luce is a friend.

2441
02:19:46,546 --> 02:19:48,756
You sat here
and let me tell you how it's done,

2442
02:19:49,507 --> 02:19:51,634
but you've been far ahead all along.

2443
02:19:51,717 --> 02:19:54,053
Survival in Washington

2444
02:19:54,929 --> 02:19:57,139
is about knowing how to get things done.

2445
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:58,641
Right.

2446
02:20:00,768 --> 02:20:02,603
What was it you said about Borden?

2447
02:20:02,687 --> 02:20:04,772
"Why get caught
holding the knife yourself?"

2448
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:09,944
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2449
02:20:12,446 --> 02:20:16,659
It's gonna come down to how much influence
Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2450
02:20:16,742 --> 02:20:17,785
[Kitty laughing]

2451
02:20:17,868 --> 02:20:19,203
[attorney]
Did I say something funny?

2452
02:20:19,287 --> 02:20:23,874
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"
when we all know that it's Strauss.

2453
02:20:23,958 --> 02:20:26,419
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

2454
02:20:26,502 --> 02:20:29,213
And then you humiliated him
in front of Congress.

2455
02:20:29,297 --> 02:20:31,799
- But more useful than a sandwich.
- [gallery laughing]

2456
02:20:35,052 --> 02:20:36,053
How'd I do?

2457
02:20:37,305 --> 02:20:39,098
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2458
02:20:39,181 --> 02:20:40,725
That was six years ago.

2459
02:20:40,808 --> 02:20:44,353
You know the truly vindictive,
patient as saints.

2460
02:20:44,437 --> 02:20:47,106
Strauss has been perfectly clear
that he is neutral.

2461
02:20:47,189 --> 02:20:50,651
- [glass shatters]
- Wake up! It is Strauss!

2462
02:20:50,735 --> 02:20:53,696
It's always been Strauss, and you know it.

2463
02:20:53,779 --> 02:20:55,406
Why won't you fight him?

2464
02:20:56,115 --> 02:20:57,283
Christ's sake.

2465
02:20:58,659 --> 02:21:02,455
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover,
or one of Truman's guys.

2466
02:21:02,538 --> 02:21:04,915
It was you. You gave the file to Borden.

2467
02:21:04,999 --> 02:21:07,293
You set him on Oppenheimer.
You convinced him to—

2468
02:21:07,376 --> 02:21:11,797
Borden didn't take any convincing.

2469
02:21:11,881 --> 02:21:13,716
Take your time, use the entire file.

2470
02:21:13,799 --> 02:21:16,135
Write up your conclusions,
send them to the FBI.

2471
02:21:16,218 --> 02:21:20,556
The material is obviously extensive,
but there's nothing new here.

2472
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:22,725
[Strauss] Your conclusions will be.

2473
02:21:22,808 --> 02:21:24,852
And they'll have to be answered.

2474
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:26,687
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2475
02:21:26,771 --> 02:21:30,149
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2476
02:21:30,232 --> 02:21:33,027
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2477
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:34,779
while you do this with the AEC.

2478
02:21:34,862 --> 02:21:35,988
A trial.

2479
02:21:36,072 --> 02:21:37,365
No. No trial.

2480
02:21:37,448 --> 02:21:40,201
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

2481
02:21:40,284 --> 02:21:42,119
You can't martyr him.

2482
02:21:42,203 --> 02:21:45,456
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2483
02:21:45,539 --> 02:21:48,876
so he can never again speak
on matters of national security.

2484
02:21:49,669 --> 02:21:50,670
Then what?

2485
02:21:52,338 --> 02:21:55,633
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2486
02:21:55,716 --> 02:21:57,259
[chattering]

2487
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:03,474
[Strauss]
<i>A simple, bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2488
02:22:03,557 --> 02:22:05,893
His Q clearance is up for renewal.

2489
02:22:05,976 --> 02:22:08,604
You send your accusations to the FBI...

2490
02:22:10,898 --> 02:22:13,984
Hoover sends them to the AEC,
you're forced to act.

2491
02:22:15,027 --> 02:22:16,278
You write up an indictment.

2492
02:22:16,362 --> 02:22:20,324
<i>You tell Oppenheimer his security
clearance is not being renewed.</i>

2493
02:22:20,408 --> 02:22:22,368
<i>But offer him the chance to appeal.</i>

2494
02:22:22,451 --> 02:22:24,745
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2495
02:22:24,829 --> 02:22:27,164
- May I keep this?
- No.

2496
02:22:27,248 --> 02:22:30,960
If you do decide to appeal,
they'll have to send you a copy.

2497
02:22:31,043 --> 02:22:34,672
When he appeals, and trust me, he will,

2498
02:22:34,755 --> 02:22:36,757
- I appoint a board.
- [chattering]

2499
02:22:36,841 --> 02:22:39,552
They will, of course, have counsel.

2500
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:41,303
- [Nichols] Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

2501
02:22:41,387 --> 02:22:43,305
- Who?
- Roger Robb.

2502
02:22:43,389 --> 02:22:44,390
Ouch.

2503
02:22:44,473 --> 02:22:47,685
Robb will have security clearance
to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2504
02:22:47,768 --> 02:22:49,103
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2505
02:22:49,186 --> 02:22:50,438
Defense counsel will not.

2506
02:22:51,731 --> 02:22:53,023
A closed hearing.

2507
02:22:53,107 --> 02:22:57,278
"The so-called and derogatory information
in your indictment of me..."

2508
02:22:57,361 --> 02:23:00,906
No audience.
No reporters. No burden of proof.

2509
02:23:01,490 --> 02:23:02,992
No burden of proof?

2510
02:23:04,618 --> 02:23:05,786
We're not convicting.

02:23:06,871 --> 02:23:08,497
We're just denying.

2512
02:23:14,295 --> 02:23:16,255
What is it you said?

2513
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:20,468
"This is just how the game is played."

2514
02:23:21,177 --> 02:23:22,928
Well, forgive my naivete.

2515
02:23:23,596 --> 02:23:27,266
Amateurs seek the sun... get eaten.

2516
02:23:28,601 --> 02:23:31,645
Power stays in the shadows.

2517
02:23:31,729 --> 02:23:34,690
But, sir, you're out of the shadows now.

2518
02:23:34,774 --> 02:23:36,734
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2519
02:23:36,817 --> 02:23:37,985
Well...

2520
02:23:39,695 --> 02:23:42,364
Teller's testifying this morning.
That'll help.

2521
02:23:42,448 --> 02:23:43,949
And then...

2522
02:23:44,033 --> 02:23:45,409
Hill is in the afternoon.

2523
02:23:45,493 --> 02:23:47,119
Hill is gonna help us too.

2524
02:23:50,206 --> 02:23:52,833
[Strauss] As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2525
02:23:53,501 --> 02:23:55,169
- May I keep this?
- [Nichols] No.

2526
02:23:57,671 --> 02:24:02,635
If you do decide to appeal,
then they'll have to send you a copy.

2527
02:24:06,055 --> 02:24:08,140
Take my car and driver. I insist.

2528
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,980
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2529
02:24:15,064 --> 02:24:17,775
Of course. But don't take too long.

2530
02:24:17,858 --> 02:24:19,902
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2531
02:24:26,158 --> 02:24:28,369
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

2532
02:24:28,452 --> 02:24:29,912
I think it's wrong.

2533
02:24:42,967 --> 02:24:46,428
[Oppenheimer] <i>Nichols wants me to fight
so he can get it all on the record.</i>

2534
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:48,264
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2535
02:24:48,347 --> 02:24:53,018
Strauss knows that you can't do that.
You'd be accepting the charges.

2536
02:24:53,686 --> 02:24:55,229
You'll lose your job.

2537
02:24:55,312 --> 02:24:58,232
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

2538
02:24:58,315 --> 02:24:59,984
Robert, we have to fight.

2539
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:05,155
As AEC counsel,
I can't represent you.

2540
02:25:05,239 --> 02:25:06,782
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2541
02:25:07,366 --> 02:25:09,577
- He's good.
- The best, but...

2542
02:25:10,578 --> 02:25:11,704
I have to warn you...

2543
02:25:13,372 --> 02:25:15,416
this won't be a fair fight.

2544
02:25:15,499 --> 02:25:18,043
During your interview
with Boris Pash in 1943,

2545
02:25:18,127 --> 02:25:19,753
did you refer to microfilm?

2546
02:25:19,837 --> 02:25:23,007
- No.
- Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2547
02:25:23,090 --> 02:25:24,466
You never said, "Man of the consulate

2548
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:26,510
expert in the use of microfilm."

2549
02:25:26,594 --> 02:25:27,636
- [Garrison] I'm sorry.
- No.

2550
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:29,889
I would like to know what document
Mr. Robb is quoting from

2551
02:25:29,972 --> 02:25:31,932
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

2552
02:25:32,016 --> 02:25:33,809
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

2553
02:25:33,893 --> 02:25:36,061
I think we should get back
to firsthand information.

2554
02:25:36,145 --> 02:25:38,814
- This is firsthand.
- How so, Roger?

2555
02:25:40,774 --> 02:25:42,151
There was a recording of the interview.

2556
02:25:46,947 --> 02:25:49,867
[Garrison] You let my client sit here
and potentially perjure himself

2557
02:25:49,950 --> 02:25:52,411
and all this time, you had a recording?

2558
02:25:52,494 --> 02:25:55,122
Nobody told your client
to misrepresent his former answers.

2559
02:25:55,205 --> 02:25:57,333
Misrepres-
It was 12 years ago.

2560
02:25:57,416 --> 02:25:58,667
Can we hear this recording?

2561
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:00,169
You don't have the clearance,
Mr. Garrison.

2562
02:26:00,252 --> 02:26:03,255
- But you're reading it into the record.
- Please, please.

2563
02:26:03,339 --> 02:26:07,176
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

2564
02:26:07,259 --> 02:26:11,096
If it's truth, where's the disclosure?
Where's the witness list?

2565
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:13,891
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial,
as you're well aware.

2566
02:26:13,974 --> 02:26:18,145
Evidentiary rules do not apply.
We are dealing with national security.

2567
02:26:18,228 --> 02:26:19,438
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2568
02:26:19,521 --> 02:26:22,900
I fail to see how national security
prevents the prosecution

2569
02:26:22,983 --> 02:26:25,903
- from providing us a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.

2570
02:26:25,986 --> 02:26:28,030
[Oppenheimer]
Gentlemen, you have my words.

2571
02:26:28,113 --> 02:26:30,950
If you say they're from a transcript,
then I'll accept it.

2572
02:26:31,033 --> 02:26:33,744
I've already explained
I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2573
02:26:33,827 --> 02:26:36,914
But why would anyone
make up such an elaborate story?

2574
02:26:36,997 --> 02:26:38,457
Because I was an idiot.

2575
02:26:39,166 --> 02:26:40,793
Why lie?

2576
02:26:40,876 --> 02:26:44,797
Well, clearly with the intention
of not revealing who the intermediary was.

2577
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:47,424
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier,
the communist?

2578
02:26:47,508 --> 02:26:48,759
Is he still your friend?

2579
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,803
Yes.

2580
02:26:54,056 --> 02:26:56,183
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

2581
02:26:56,266 --> 02:26:58,060
Do you know who else
the prosecution has called?

2582
02:26:58,143 --> 02:27:00,354
Teller, obviously.

2583
02:27:01,355 --> 02:27:03,691
- They've asked Lawrence.
- What did he say?

2584
02:27:03,774 --> 02:27:07,069
- He wasn't going to help them, but...
- But?

2585
02:27:07,653 --> 02:27:12,116
Strauss told him that you and Ruth Tolman
have been having an affair for years.

2586
02:27:12,199 --> 02:27:14,576
The whole time you lived with them
in Pasadena.

2587
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:18,038
He convinced Lawrence
that Richard died of a broken heart.

2588
02:27:18,122 --> 02:27:19,957
- That's absurd.
- What part?

2589
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:21,834
The broken heart.

2590
02:27:21,917 --> 02:27:22,960
Richard never found out.

2591
02:27:24,336 --> 02:27:25,671
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2592
02:27:25,754 --> 02:27:26,880
I don't know.

2593
02:27:27,798 --> 02:27:32,511
[Garrison] Dr. Rabi, what governmental
positions do you currently hold?

2594
02:27:32,594 --> 02:27:36,473
I am the chairman of
the General Advisory Committee to the AEC,

2595
02:27:36,557 --> 02:27:38,350
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2596
02:27:38,434 --> 02:27:40,561
And how long have you known
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2597
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:43,522
Since 1928. I...

2598
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:45,107
I know him quite well.

2599
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:49,737
Well enough to speak to the bearing
of his loyalty and character?

2600
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:53,240
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

2601
02:27:53,866 --> 02:27:57,619
And he is loyal to the United States,
to his friends,

2602
02:27:57,703 --> 02:27:59,955
to the institutions of which he is part.

2603
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:03,042
Eat.

2604
02:28:05,919 --> 02:28:07,921
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

2605
02:28:22,061 --> 02:28:24,313
- [Oppenheimer] What was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

2606
02:28:27,566 --> 02:28:29,485
[Robb] <i>After the Russian A-bomb test,</i>

2607
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:32,196
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you
about the hydrogen bomb?

2608
02:28:32,279 --> 02:28:33,864
You'd be better off asking him.

2609
02:28:33,947 --> 02:28:35,491
Well, I fully intend to.

2610
02:28:36,325 --> 02:28:40,245
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2611
02:28:40,329 --> 02:28:43,332
No, he thought that a fusion program

2612
02:28:43,415 --> 02:28:46,168
would come at the expense
of our awfully good fission program.

2613
02:28:46,251 --> 02:28:50,172
- But that proved not to be the case.
- In the event, both could be done.

2614
02:28:50,255 --> 02:28:52,925
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied that,

2615
02:28:53,008 --> 02:28:57,012
in his testimony here,
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful.

2616
02:28:57,096 --> 02:28:59,181
What would you say whether or not
he should be cleared?

2617
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:01,558
Why go through all this against a man

2618
02:29:01,642 --> 02:29:03,685
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2619
02:29:03,769 --> 02:29:05,312
Look at his record.

2620
02:29:05,395 --> 02:29:07,648
We have an A-bomb
and a whole series of it.

2621
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:09,566
We have a whole series of Super bombs.

2622
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:12,194
What more do you want? Mermaids?

2623
02:29:12,736 --> 02:29:16,323
[Teller] <i>But I've known Secretary Strauss
for many years,</i>

2624
02:29:16,406 --> 02:29:19,868
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

2625
02:29:19,952 --> 02:29:22,371
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

2626
02:29:22,454 --> 02:29:25,332
We'll break now,
unless there's any immediate business.

2627
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:28,210
[Strauss]
Senator, I'd like to once again request

2628
02:29:28,293 --> 02:29:31,004
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

2629
02:29:31,088 --> 02:29:32,798
And I will remind the nominee

2630
02:29:32,881 --> 02:29:35,509
that we don't always have
that information in advance.

2631
02:29:35,592 --> 02:29:38,679
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

2632
02:29:38,762 --> 02:29:41,515
Mr. Chairman,
our next scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2633
02:29:41,598 --> 02:29:44,393
has apparently come down with colitis.

2634
02:29:47,729 --> 02:29:50,107
So we'll proceed
with William Borden instead.

2635
02:29:51,066 --> 02:29:53,819
Mr. Borden, welcome. Please take a seat.

2636
02:29:55,154 --> 02:29:59,867
Mr. Borden, during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2637
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:02,911
- did you reach certain conclusions?
- I did.

2638
02:30:02,995 --> 02:30:05,581
And did there come a time
when you expressed those conclusions

2639
02:30:05,664 --> 02:30:09,084
in a letter to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2640
02:30:09,168 --> 02:30:11,461
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing of the letter,

2641
02:30:11,545 --> 02:30:13,839
did you discuss the writing of the letter
with anybody attached

2642
02:30:13,922 --> 02:30:15,591
to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2643
02:30:15,674 --> 02:30:17,843
- I did not.
- [Robb] Do you have a copy of the letter?

2644
02:30:17,926 --> 02:30:18,969
I have one in front of me.

2645
02:30:19,052 --> 02:30:21,346
Would you please be so kind
as to read it, sir?

2646
02:30:22,014 --> 02:30:24,850
"Dear Mr. Hoover,
the purpose of this letter is to state"—

2647
02:30:24,933 --> 02:30:27,728
[Garrison]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have a—

2648
02:30:27,811 --> 02:30:31,064
What is the purpose of the delay?
He's simply gonna read the letter.

2649
02:30:31,148 --> 02:30:34,401
[chuckles] Mr. Chairman, this is
the first I've seen of this letter,

2650
02:30:34,484 --> 02:30:37,446
and I see statements here, at least one,

2651
02:30:37,529 --> 02:30:40,032
of a kind that I don't think anyone
would like to see go into the record.

2652
02:30:40,115 --> 02:30:42,743
These are accusations
that have not previously been made.

2653
02:30:42,826 --> 02:30:44,661
That are not part of the indictment
from Nichols.

2654
02:30:44,745 --> 02:30:47,080
Accusations of a kind
that I don't think belong here.

2655
02:30:47,164 --> 02:30:49,249
The witness wrote this letter
on his own initiative,

2656
02:30:49,333 --> 02:30:51,627
laying out evidence
that has already been before the board.

2657
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:53,378
His conclusions are valid testimony,

2658
02:30:53,462 --> 02:30:56,715
just like the positive conclusions
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2659
02:30:56,798 --> 02:30:58,342
It cuts both ways.

2660
02:30:58,425 --> 02:31:00,552
How long has counsel
been in possession of this letter?

2661
02:31:00,636 --> 02:31:04,556
I don't think I should be subject
to cross-examination by you, Mr. Garrison.

2662
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:07,726
[Gray] Mr. Garrison, given that we
on the board have all read the letter,

2663
02:31:07,809 --> 02:31:10,145
wouldn't it be better
to have it in the record?

2664
02:31:10,229 --> 02:31:11,772
Let's proceed.

2665
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:15,317
[Borden] "Dear Mr. Hoover,

2666
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:18,445
the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

2667
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:22,699
based upon years of study
of the available classified evidence,

2668
02:31:22,783 --> 02:31:24,785
that more probably than not

2669
02:31:24,868 --> 02:31:29,706
J. Robert Oppenheimer
is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2670
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:32,209
The following conclusions are justified.

2671
02:31:32,292 --> 02:31:36,630
One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

2672
02:31:36,713 --> 02:31:40,550
J. Robert Oppenheimer
was a sufficiently hardened communist,

2673
02:31:40,634 --> 02:31:43,011
that he volunteered information
to the Soviets.

2674
02:31:43,095 --> 02:31:45,430
Two, more probably than not,

2675
02:31:45,514 --> 02:31:49,142
he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

2676
02:31:49,810 --> 02:31:52,312
Three, more probably than not,

2677
02:31:52,396 --> 02:31:54,982
he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

2678
02:31:55,065 --> 02:31:57,859
in influencing
United States military policy"...

2679
02:31:57,943 --> 02:32:00,195
- I'm sorry, Robert.
- ..."atomic energy, intelligence"...

2680
02:32:00,279 --> 02:32:05,158
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth
about what's happening here?

2681
02:32:05,242 --> 02:32:08,078
[chairman]
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

2682
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:09,579
[shutters clicking]

2683
02:32:14,835 --> 02:32:15,836
[shutter clicks]

2684
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:21,383
Dr. Hill, would you care
to make a statement?

2685
02:32:23,385 --> 02:32:24,386
Thank you.

2686
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:28,473
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

2687
02:32:28,557 --> 02:32:33,812
A man who has given years of service
in high positions of government

2688
02:32:33,895 --> 02:32:38,650
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

2689
02:32:39,818 --> 02:32:42,321
The views I have to express are my own,

2690
02:32:42,404 --> 02:32:45,157
but I believe that much I have to say
will help to indicate

2691
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:48,702
why most of the scientists in this country

2692
02:32:48,785 --> 02:32:53,582
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss
completely out of government.

2693
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:55,667
[gallery murmuring]

2694
02:32:55,751 --> 02:32:59,671
You're referring to the hostility
of certain scientists

2695
02:32:59,755 --> 02:33:03,467
directed toward Mr. Strauss
because of his commitment to security,

2696
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:06,261
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

2697
02:33:08,722 --> 02:33:09,723
No.

2698
02:33:10,515 --> 02:33:15,062
Because of the personal vindictiveness
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2699
02:33:15,145 --> 02:33:16,730
[murmuring intensifies]

2700
02:33:16,813 --> 02:33:18,690
- [chairman] Order.
- [gavel rapping]

2701
02:33:18,774 --> 02:33:20,025
Order.

2702
02:33:20,609 --> 02:33:24,112
It appears to most scientists
around this country

2703
02:33:25,405 --> 02:33:28,241
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being pilloried

2704
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:32,746
and put through an ordeal
because he expressed his honest opinions.

2705
02:33:32,829 --> 02:33:36,041
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing
a service to my country

2706
02:33:36,124 --> 02:33:37,250
when hearing this case.

2707
02:33:37,334 --> 02:33:41,838
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

2708
02:33:41,922 --> 02:33:44,007
because he expressed strong opinions.

2709
02:33:44,091 --> 02:33:46,760
If you wanna try that case,
you should try me.

2710
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:50,472
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred.

2711
02:33:51,348 --> 02:33:52,349
But I am.

2712
02:33:52,933 --> 02:33:56,812
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that
Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2713
02:33:56,895 --> 02:33:59,856
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2714
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:04,611
The Oppenheimer matter
was initiated and carried through

2715
02:34:04,694 --> 02:34:07,155
largely through the animus
of Lewis Strauss.

2716
02:34:07,239 --> 02:34:08,615
[gallery murmuring]

2717
02:34:08,698 --> 02:34:11,576
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

2718
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:13,703
on the shipment of isotopes to Norway,

2719
02:34:13,787 --> 02:34:17,290
and Strauss never forgave him
this public humiliation.

2720
02:34:17,958 --> 02:34:21,211
Another controversy between them centered
around their differences in judgment

2721
02:34:21,294 --> 02:34:24,381
on how the H-bomb
would contribute to national security.

2722
02:34:24,464 --> 02:34:26,925
Strauss turned
to the personnel security system

2723
02:34:27,008 --> 02:34:30,595
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness.

2724
02:34:30,679 --> 02:34:33,557
And Strauss was able
to find a few ambitious men

2725
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:36,393
who also disagreed
with Oppenheimer's positions

2726
02:34:36,476 --> 02:34:39,855
and envied him
his prestige in government circles.

2727
02:34:39,938 --> 02:34:44,025
I've always assumed, and still assume,
that he's loyal to the United States.

2728
02:34:44,651 --> 02:34:45,652
I believe this.

2729
02:34:45,735 --> 02:34:49,156
And I shall believe it until I see
very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2730
02:34:49,239 --> 02:34:52,951
Do you, or do you not, believe that
Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2731
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:58,123
In a great number of cases,

2732
02:34:58,206 --> 02:35:01,543
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way which was, to me,

2733
02:35:01,626 --> 02:35:03,545
exceedingly hard to understand.

2734
02:35:03,628 --> 02:35:06,214
I thoroughly disagreed with him
in numerous issues,

2735
02:35:06,298 --> 02:35:09,718
and his actions, frankly,
appeared to me confused and complicated.

2736
02:35:09,801 --> 02:35:11,511
To this extent, I feel,

2737
02:35:11,595 --> 02:35:14,556
I want to see the vital interests
of this country

2738
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:16,725
in hands which I understand better,

2739
02:35:16,808 --> 02:35:18,643
and therefore trust more.

2740
02:35:19,478 --> 02:35:21,229
- Thank you, Doctor.
- [Robb] Thank you.

2741
02:35:24,983 --> 02:35:26,067
I'm sorry.

2742
02:35:28,862 --> 02:35:31,114
[Kitty] <i>You shook his fucking hand?</i>

2743
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:33,992
Oh, I would have spit in his face.

2744
02:35:34,075 --> 02:35:35,994
Not sure the board
would have appreciated that.

2745
02:35:36,077 --> 02:35:37,954
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

2746
02:35:38,038 --> 02:35:40,624
I think you're all being
too goddamn gentlemanly.

2747
02:35:40,707 --> 02:35:42,626
Gray must see what Robb is doing.

2748
02:35:42,709 --> 02:35:44,544
Why doesn't he just shut him down?

2749
02:35:44,628 --> 02:35:47,214
And you shaking Teller's hand.

2750
02:35:47,297 --> 02:35:50,342
You need to stop playing the martyr.

2751
02:35:51,134 --> 02:35:56,097
Under the current AEC guidelines,
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2752
02:36:02,103 --> 02:36:06,650
Under my interpretation
of the Atomic Energy Act,

2753
02:36:06,733 --> 02:36:11,321
which did not exist
when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2754
02:36:12,614 --> 02:36:18,119
I would not clear him today
if I were on the commission.

2755
02:36:18,203 --> 02:36:19,746
[Robb]
Good, thank you, General, that is all.

2756
02:36:19,829 --> 02:36:22,332
But I don't think
I'd clear any of those guys.

2757
02:36:22,415 --> 02:36:23,416
That's all.

2758
02:36:26,503 --> 02:36:28,630
[Garrison]
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility

2759
02:36:28,713 --> 02:36:31,216
in the selection or the clearance
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2760
02:36:31,299 --> 02:36:32,551
No. None at all.

2761
02:36:32,634 --> 02:36:35,804
And you wouldn't want to leave this board
with any suggestion today

2762
02:36:35,887 --> 02:36:39,015
that you're here questioning
his basic loyalty to the United States

2763
02:36:39,099 --> 02:36:40,600
and the operation of Los Alamos.

2764
02:36:40,684 --> 02:36:42,018
By no means.

2765
02:36:42,102 --> 02:36:45,021
I hope I didn't lead anyone
to believe otherwise for an instant.

2766
02:36:46,314 --> 02:36:47,524
[Gray] Thank you, General.

2767
02:36:56,908 --> 02:36:58,618
[door opens]

2768
02:37:05,041 --> 02:37:07,168
Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting.

2769
02:37:07,252 --> 02:37:08,253
She'll be here.

2770
02:37:08,753 --> 02:37:10,046
Do you even want her here?

2771
02:37:10,630 --> 02:37:12,549
Only a fool or an adolescent

2772
02:37:12,632 --> 02:37:14,676
presumes to know
someone else's relationship,

2773
02:37:14,759 --> 02:37:16,678
and you're neither, Lloyd.

She'll do fine.

2778
02:37:28,064 --> 02:37:32,235
[Garrison] Would you describe your views
on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2779
02:37:32,319 --> 02:37:33,403
[Kitty] Very strongly against.

2780
02:37:33,486 --> 02:37:38,033
I've had nothing to do with communism
since 1936, since...

2781
02:37:39,159 --> 02:37:40,994
since before I met Robert.

2782
02:37:42,787 --> 02:37:43,913
That's all.

2783
02:37:44,998 --> 02:37:46,750
[Hill]
<i>The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer</i>

2784
02:37:46,833 --> 02:37:50,045
<i>was not interrogated
by impartial and disinterested counsel</i>

2785
02:37:50,128 --> 02:37:51,129
<i>for the Gray board.</i>

2786
02:37:51,212 --> 02:37:53,048
<i>He was interrogated by a prosecutor</i>

2787
02:37:53,131 --> 02:37:55,842
<i>who used all the tricks
of a rather ingenious legal background.</i>

2788
02:37:55,925 --> 02:38:00,263
You are charging now that
the Gray board permitted a prosecution.

2789
02:38:01,014 --> 02:38:03,099
If I were on the Gray board,

2790
02:38:03,183 --> 02:38:06,519
I would have protested against the tactics
of the man who served, in fact,

2791
02:38:06,603 --> 02:38:08,063
as the prosecuting counsel.

2792
02:38:08,146 --> 02:38:09,981
A man appointed, not by the board...

2793
02:38:11,274 --> 02:38:12,567
but by Lewis Strauss.

Uh, Roger Robb.

Mrs. Oppenheimer.

Did you have
a Communist Party membership card?

I'm not sure.

Not sure?

Well—

2805

Well?

2806
02:38:53,358 --> 02:38:56,361
I mean, presumably,
the act of joining the Party

2807
02:38:56,444 --> 02:38:59,656
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

2808
02:39:02,617 --> 02:39:03,618
Yeah.

2809

[sighs]

2810
02:39:09,666 --> 02:39:10,834
Sorry.

2811
02:39:11,876 --> 02:39:13,211
[Robb] Yeah.

2812
02:39:15,255 --> 02:39:18,591
It's just it was all so very long ago,
Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

02:39:18,675 --> 02:39:20,301
- Not really.
- Long enough to have forgotten.

2814
02:39:20,385 --> 02:39:23,513
- Did you return the card or rip it up?
- The card whose existence I've forgotten?

2815
02:39:23,596 --> 02:39:26,558
- Your Communist Party membership card.
- Haven't the slightest idea.

2816
02:39:29,394 --> 02:39:33,815
Can a distinction be made between
Soviet communism and communism?

2817
02:39:33,898 --> 02:39:37,026
In the days when I was a member,
I thought they were definitely two things.

2818
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:40,155
I thought that the Communist Party
of the United States

2819
02:39:40,238 --> 02:39:42,699
was concerned with our domestic problems.

2820
02:39:42,782 --> 02:39:43,950
I now no longer believe this.

2821
02:39:44,033 --> 02:39:46,536
I believe the thing's linked together
and spread all over the world,

2822
02:39:46,619 --> 02:39:50,331
and I have believed this
since I left the Party, 16 years ago.

2823
02:39:50,415 --> 02:39:52,917
- But-
- 17 years ago. My mistake.

2824
02:39:53,501 --> 02:39:54,919
- But you sai-
- Sorry, 18.

2825
02:39:56,337 --> 02:39:57,630
18 years ago.

2826
02:39:58,882 --> 02:40:01,760
Are you familiar with the fact
your husband was making contributions

2827
02:40:01,843 --> 02:40:04,012
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?

2828
02:40:04,095 --> 02:40:06,389
I knew that Robert
gave money from time to time.

2829
02:40:06,473 --> 02:40:08,933
Did you know this money
was going into Communist Party channels?

2830
02:40:09,017 --> 02:40:11,060
- Don't you mean "through"?
- Pardon?

2831
02:40:11,144 --> 02:40:13,646
I think you mean "through
Communist Party channels," don't you?

2832
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:15,315
- Yes!
- Yes?

2833
02:40:15,398 --> 02:40:17,442
- Yes!
- Yes.

2834
02:40:17,525 --> 02:40:20,528
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

2835
02:40:20,612 --> 02:40:24,491
your husband had not stopped having
anything to do with the Communist Party?

2836
02:40:24,574 --> 02:40:27,577
You don't have to answer that yes or no.
You can answer that any way you wish.

2837
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:29,370
I know that, thank you.

2838
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:31,206
It's your question.

2839
02:40:31,289 --> 02:40:32,749
It's not properly phrased.

2840
02:40:32,832 --> 02:40:34,501
- Do you understand what I'm getting at?
- I do.

2841
02:40:34,584 --> 02:40:37,545
- Then why don't you answer it that way?
- 'Cause I don't like your phrase.

2842
02:40:37,629 --> 02:40:39,464
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

2843
02:40:39,547 --> 02:40:42,675
Because Robert never had anything to do
with the Communist Party as such.

2844
02:40:42,759 --> 02:40:45,094
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

2845
02:40:45,178 --> 02:40:48,348
I know he took an intellectual interest
in communist ideas—

2846
02:40:48,431 --> 02:40:50,183
Are there two types of communists?

2847
02:40:50,266 --> 02:40:52,977
Intellectual communists
and your plain, old, regular commie?

2848
02:40:53,061 --> 02:40:54,187
[laughs]

2849
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:55,897
Well, I couldn't answer that one.

2850
02:40:55,980 --> 02:40:58,525
[Evans chuckles] I couldn't either.

2851
02:41:05,448 --> 02:41:06,699
Good evening.

2852
02:41:06,783 --> 02:41:08,117
Robert, you can't win this thing.

2853
02:41:08,201 --> 02:41:10,495
It's a kangaroo court
with a predetermined outcome.

2854
02:41:10,578 --> 02:41:14,499
- Why put yourself through more of it?
- I have my reasons.

2855
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:17,168
All right.

2856
02:41:17,252 --> 02:41:18,461
Good night.

2857
02:41:18,545 --> 02:41:19,796
[car door closes]

2858
02:41:23,174 --> 02:41:24,509
He has a point.

2859
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,595
I'm not sure you understand, Albert.

2860
02:41:27,679 --> 02:41:28,721
No?

2861
02:41:29,305 --> 02:41:31,933
I left my country never to return.

2862
02:41:32,892 --> 02:41:34,978
You served your country well.

2863
02:41:35,061 --> 02:41:37,939
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

2864
02:41:38,898 --> 02:41:41,234
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

2865
02:41:42,277 --> 02:41:44,320
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

2866
02:41:45,113 --> 02:41:47,407
Then tell them to go to hell.

2867
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:48,950
Interestingly enough,

2868
02:41:49,033 --> 02:41:51,452
this is no longer a confirmation hearing,

2869
02:41:51,536 --> 02:41:54,330
it's now a trial about a trial!

2870
02:41:56,124 --> 02:41:59,043
It's not good he's telling everyone
you initiated the hearings.

2871
02:41:59,127 --> 02:42:01,170
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2872
02:42:01,254 --> 02:42:04,757
He certainly can't prove
that I gave the file to Borden.

2873
02:42:04,841 --> 02:42:07,886
We're not in court, sir.
There's no burden of proof.

2874
02:42:07,969 --> 02:42:09,679
Right. They're not convicting...

2875
02:42:10,597 --> 02:42:11,598
just denying.

2876
02:42:12,515 --> 02:42:15,435
But why would Hill come here
to tear me down? What's his angle?

2877
02:42:15,518 --> 02:42:18,313
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

2878
02:42:18,396 --> 02:42:19,314
As he sees it.

2879
02:42:19,397 --> 02:42:22,692
I told you, Oppenheimer poisoned
the scientists against me,

2880
02:42:22,775 --> 02:42:24,152
right from that first meeting.

2881
02:42:24,235 --> 02:42:27,238
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,</i>

2882
02:42:27,322 --> 02:42:30,199
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

2883
02:42:30,283 --> 02:42:31,618
[no audible dialogue]

2884
02:42:31,701 --> 02:42:34,537
[Strauss] <i>Oppenheimer knows
how to manipulate his own.</i>

2885
02:42:34,621 --> 02:42:38,374
And at Los Alamos,
he preyed on the naivete of scientists

2886
02:42:38,458 --> 02:42:40,627
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work.

2887
02:42:40,710 --> 02:42:42,921
Don't ever think
he was that naive himself.

2888
02:42:43,671 --> 02:42:45,048
[Robb] Doctor.

2889
02:42:45,131 --> 02:42:49,928
During your work on the hydrogen bomb,
were you deterred by any moral qualms?

2890
02:42:50,762 --> 02:42:51,971
Yes, of course.

2891
02:42:52,055 --> 02:42:53,890
But you still got on with your work,
didn't you?

2892
02:42:53,973 --> 02:42:58,144
Yes, because this was work of exploration.
It was not the preparation of a weapon.

2893
02:42:58,227 --> 02:43:00,313
You mean it was more of
an academic excursion?

2894
02:43:00,396 --> 02:43:03,399
No, it is not an academic thing
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2895
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:04,692
It's a matter of life and death.

2896
02:43:04,776 --> 02:43:05,985
By 1942,

2897
02:43:06,069 --> 02:43:08,321
you were actively pushing the development
of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2898
02:43:08,404 --> 02:43:11,574
Pushing's not the right word.
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2899
02:43:11,658 --> 02:43:14,035
So when did these moral qualms
become so strong

2900
02:43:14,118 --> 02:43:17,121
that you actively opposed the development
of the hydrogen bomb?

2901
02:43:17,205 --> 02:43:19,958
When it was suggested
that it be the policy of the United States

2902
02:43:20,041 --> 02:43:22,877
to make these things at all cost,
without regard to the balance

2903
02:43:22,961 --> 02:43:26,464
between these weapons
and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2904
02:43:27,924 --> 02:43:30,009
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

2905
02:43:30,718 --> 02:43:33,554
- What do moral qualms have to do with it?
- Yes.

2906
02:43:33,638 --> 02:43:35,723
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

2907
02:43:35,807 --> 02:43:37,767
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

2908
02:43:37,850 --> 02:43:42,313
He talks about putting
the nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2909
02:43:42,397 --> 02:43:45,900
Well, I'm here to tell you
that I know J. Robert Oppenheimer,

2910
02:43:45,984 --> 02:43:49,195
and if he could do it all over,
he'd do it all the same.

2911
02:43:49,278 --> 02:43:52,991
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

2912
02:43:53,074 --> 02:43:55,827
He'd do it all over. Why?

2913
02:43:55,910 --> 02:43:59,706
Because it made him
the most important man who ever lived.

2914
02:43:59,789 --> 02:44:03,543
[stammering]
Well, we've freely used the atomic bomb—

2915
02:44:03,626 --> 02:44:05,670
[Robb] In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting the target

2916
02:44:05,753 --> 02:44:07,922
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan,
didn't you?

2917
02:44:08,006 --> 02:44:09,882
- Yes.
- [Robb] Then you knew, did you not,

2918
02:44:09,966 --> 02:44:12,218
that by dropping that atomic bomb
on the target you selected,

2919
02:44:12,301 --> 02:44:15,221
that thousands of civilians would be
killed or injured, is that correct?

2920
02:44:15,304 --> 02:44:17,473
- Yes, not as many as turned out-
- [feet stamping]

2921
02:44:17,557 --> 02:44:20,059
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

2922
02:44:20,143 --> 02:44:21,227
70,000.

2923
02:44:21,310 --> 02:44:22,687
70,000 at both Hiroshima and—

2924
02:44:22,770 --> 02:44:24,522
110,000 at both.

2925
02:44:24,605 --> 02:44:26,190
[Robb] On the day of each bombing?

2926
02:44:27,734 --> 02:44:29,986
- Yes.
- And in the weeks and years that followed?

2927
02:44:30,069 --> 02:44:33,322
It has been put at somewhere
between 50,000 and 100,000.

2928
02:44:33,406 --> 02:44:35,491
- 220,000 dead, at least.
- [Oppenheimer] Yes.

2929
02:44:35,575 --> 02:44:37,118
Any moral scruples about that?

2930
02:44:39,037 --> 02:44:40,038
Terrible ones.

2931
02:44:40,121 --> 02:44:43,916
Yet you testified in here that the bombing
of Hiroshima was very successful.

2932
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,045
- Technically successful.
- Oh! Technically, it was very successful.

2933
02:44:47,128 --> 02:44:49,505
And it is also alleged
to have helped end the war.

2934
02:44:49,589 --> 02:44:52,675
Would you have been supportive of the
dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2935
02:44:52,759 --> 02:44:55,136
- That would make no sense at all.
- Why?

2936
02:44:55,219 --> 02:44:57,055
[stammering] The target is too small.

2937
02:44:57,138 --> 02:44:59,640
Well, supposing there had been
a target in Japan big enough

2938
02:44:59,724 --> 02:45:01,100
for a thermonuclear weapon,

2939
02:45:01,184 --> 02:45:02,727
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

2940
02:45:02,810 --> 02:45:04,520
This was not a problem
with which I was confronted—

2941
02:45:04,604 --> 02:45:06,064
I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

2942
02:45:06,147 --> 02:45:07,815
It was all part of his plan.

2943
02:45:07,899 --> 02:45:11,736
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt
of the self-important

2944
02:45:11,819 --> 02:45:13,780
to wear like a fucking crown.

2945
02:45:13,863 --> 02:45:19,368
Say, "No, we cannot go down this road,"
even as he knew we'd have to.

2946
02:45:19,452 --> 02:45:21,120
Would you have been opposed
to the dropping

2947
02:45:21,204 --> 02:45:23,539
of a thermonuclear weapon on Japan
because of moral scruples?

2948
02:45:23,623 --> 02:45:24,999
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.
- [feet stamping]

2949
02:45:25,083 --> 02:45:26,084
Did you oppose the dropping

2950
02:45:26,167 --> 02:45:28,878
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

2951
02:45:28,961 --> 02:45:30,880
- We set forth our arg-
- No, you.

2952
02:45:30,963 --> 02:45:32,673
- I'm asking you. You!
- I set-

2953
02:45:32,757 --> 02:45:35,051
I set forth our arguments
against dropping it,

2954
02:45:35,134 --> 02:45:36,844
- but I did not endorse them.
- [stamping intensifies]

2955
02:45:36,928 --> 02:45:40,056
You mean after working night and day
for three years building the bomb,

2956
02:45:40,139 --> 02:45:42,100
you then argued against the use of it.
[laughs]

2957
02:45:42,183 --> 02:45:45,895
I was asked by the secretary of war
what the views of scientists were.

2958
02:45:45,978 --> 02:45:48,189
I gave him the views against
and the views for.

2959
02:45:48,272 --> 02:45:50,691
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

2960
02:45:50,775 --> 02:45:53,277
- What do you mean, "support"?
- [Robb] You supported it.

2961
02:45:53,361 --> 02:45:55,822
- You helped pick the target, didn't you?
- I did my job.

2962
02:45:55,905 --> 02:45:58,282
I was not in a policy-making position
at Los Alamos.

2963
02:45:58,366 --> 02:46:00,326
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

2964
02:46:00,409 --> 02:46:02,829
Then you would have built
the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2965
02:46:02,912 --> 02:46:04,956
- I couldn't.
- I didn't ask you that, Doctor.

2966
02:46:05,039 --> 02:46:06,374
And the GAC report,

2967
02:46:06,457 --> 02:46:09,043
which you co-authored
after the Soviet atomic test,

2968
02:46:09,127 --> 02:46:12,588
- said a Super bomb should never be built.
- [stamping intensifies]

What we meant— What I meant was—

2970
02:46:14,132 --> 02:46:15,967
- What you? Who? Who?
- What I meant-

2971
02:46:17,885 --> 02:46:20,763
And wouldn't the Russians
do anything to increase their strength?

2972
02:46:20,847 --> 02:46:23,391
- [stamping stops]
- if we did it, they would have to do it.

2973
02:46:23,474 --> 02:46:27,728
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,
just as it had with the atomic bomb.

2974
02:46:27,812 --> 02:46:30,815
"Just as it had with the atomic bomb,"
exactly!

2975
02:46:31,524 --> 02:46:35,778
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

2976
02:46:40,074 --> 02:46:41,242
[Gray] Dr. Oppenheimer...

2977
02:46:43,452 --> 02:46:46,205
when did
your strong moral convictions develop

2978
02:46:46,289 --> 02:46:48,082
with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

2979
02:46:55,923 --> 02:46:57,758
When it became clear to me...

2980
02:46:59,218 --> 02:47:02,263
that we would tend
to use any weapon we had.

2981

[Strauss]
<i>J. Robert Oppenheimer the Martyr.</i>

2982
02:47:07,602 --> 02:47:10,146
I gave him exactly what he wanted.

2983
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:14,358
To be remembered for Trinity,
not Hiroshima.

2984
02:47:15,109 --> 02:47:17,236
Not Nagasaki.

2985
02:47:20,198 --> 02:47:21,949
He should be thanking me.

2986
02:47:22,992 --> 02:47:24,285
Well, he's not.

2987
02:47:27,705 --> 02:47:29,123
Do we still have enough votes,

2988
02:47:29,207 --> 02:47:31,125
or is the crowning moment of my career

2989
02:47:31,209 --> 02:47:34,295
about to become
the most public humiliation of my life?

2990
02:47:35,213 --> 02:47:38,841
Full Senate's about to vote.
You'll scrape through.

2991
02:47:38,925 --> 02:47:40,509
Great, then gather the fucking press.

[Gray] Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2993
02:47:42,553 --> 02:47:45,556
This board,
having heard testimony from you

2994
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:48,851
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

2995
02:47:48,935 --> 02:47:53,022
has come to the unanimous conclusion
that you are a loyal citizen.

2996
02:47:55,274 --> 02:48:00,488
However, in the light
of your continuing associations

2997
02:48:00,571 --> 02:48:04,033
and disregard for the security apparatus
of this country,

2998
02:48:04,116 --> 02:48:07,578
together with your somewhat
disturbing conduct

2999
02:48:07,662 --> 02:48:09,580
on the hydrogen bomb program,

3000
02:48:09,664 --> 02:48:11,332
and the regrettable lack of candor

3001
02:48:11,415 --> 02:48:14,293
in certain of your responses
to this board,

3002
02:48:14,377 --> 02:48:17,213
we have voted two-to-one

3003
02:48:17,296 --> 02:48:20,341
to deny the renewal
of your security clearance.

3004
02:48:20,424 --> 02:48:23,386
A full written opinion,
with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3005
02:48:23,469 --> 02:48:26,639

02:49:07,346 --> 02:49:11,058
[Senate aide] Well, there were a couple
of unexpected holdouts.

3019
02:49:16,314 --> 02:49:18,357
I'm denied. Yeah?

3020
02:49:19,150 --> 02:49:20,818
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

Who were the holdouts?

3022

Um... There were three,

3023
02:49:32,621 --> 02:49:35,041
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

3024
02:49:35,124 --> 02:49:37,251
Young guy trying to make
a name for himself,

3025
02:49:37,335 --> 02:49:39,587
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

3026

What's his name?

3027

Uh, Kennedy. John F. Kennedy.

Kitty?

3029
02:49:55,936 --> 02:49:59,315
Did you think that if you let them
tar and feather you,

3030
02:49:59,398 --> 02:50:01,525
that the world would forgive you?

3031
02:50:05,404 --> 02:50:06,906
It won't.

3032
02:50:09,241 --> 02:50:10,451
We'll see.

3033
02:50:20,503 --> 02:50:21,962
Goddamn it.

[muttering]

02:50:24,965 --> 02:50:26,884
You told me I'd be okay.

02:50:26,967 --> 02:50:29,261
Yeah, well,
I didn't have all the facts, did I?

3037
02:50:29,345 --> 02:50:30,388
Here's a fact.

3038
02:50:30,471 --> 02:50:32,640
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

3039
02:50:32,723 --> 02:50:34,141
on my chest last year,

3040
02:50:34,225 --> 02:50:36,685
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3041
02:50:36,769 --> 02:50:39,063
They don't want me in the Cabinet room?

3042
02:50:39,146 --> 02:50:41,607
Oh, that's— That's fine.

3043
02:50:41,690 --> 02:50:43,984
Maybe they should just invite
Oppenheimer instead.

3044
02:50:44,068 --> 02:50:45,986
Maybe they will.

3045
02:50:46,070 --> 02:50:49,990
I told you, he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

3046
02:50:50,074 --> 02:50:51,242
starting with Einstein.

3047

I told you about Einstein.
I saw him by the pond.

You did, but you know, sir,

3049
02:50:55,204 --> 02:50:59,083
since nobody really knows
what they said to each other that day,

3050
02:50:59,166 --> 02:51:02,711
is it possible
they didn't talk about you at all?

3051
02:51:02,795 --> 02:51:05,047
Is it possible they spoke about something...

3052
02:51:06,215 --> 02:51:07,633

You once held a reception for me.

02:51:37,455 --> 02:51:40,875
- In Berkeley. You gave me an award, mmm?
- Yes.

3062
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:45,171
You all thought
that I had lost the ability to understand

3063
02:51:45,254 --> 02:51:47,089
what I'd started.

3064
02:51:47,173 --> 02:51:50,718
So, the award really wasn't for me.

3065
02:51:50,801 --> 02:51:53,137
It was for all of you, hmm?

3066

Now it's your turn
